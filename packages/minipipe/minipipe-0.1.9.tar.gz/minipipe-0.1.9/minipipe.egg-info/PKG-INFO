Description: 
        MiniPipe is a mini-batch pipeline designed for training machine learning models on very large datasets in a streaming 
        fashion, written in pure python. MiniPipe is designed for situations where the data are too large to fit into memory, 
        or when doing so would discourage experiment iterations due to prohibitively long loading and/or processing times.
