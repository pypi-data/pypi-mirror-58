def entropy_shannon(signal):
    """Compute the Shannon entrop (SE).

    Entropy is a measure of unpredictability of the state, or equivalently, of its average information content. Shannon entropy (SE) is one of the first and most basic measure of entropy and a foundational concept of information theory. Shannonâ€™s entropy quantifies the amount of information in a variable.


    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : list, array or Series
        The signal channel in the form of a vector of values.


    Returns
    ----------
    float
        The Shannon entropy as float value.

    See Also
    --------
    entropy_approximate, entropy_sample, entropy_fuzzy

    Examples
    ----------
    >>> import neurokit2 as nk
    >>>
    >>> signal = np.cos(np.linspace(start=0, stop=30, num=100))
    >>> nk.entropy_shannon(signal)
