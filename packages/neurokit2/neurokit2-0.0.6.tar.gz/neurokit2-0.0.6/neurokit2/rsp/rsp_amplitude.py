def rsp_amplitude(rsp_signal, extrema, desired_length=None):
    """Compute respiratory amplitude.

    Compute respiratory amplitude given the raw respiration signal and its
    extrema.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rsp_signal : list, array or Series
        The raw respiration channel (as measured, for instance, by a
        respiration belt).
    extrema : DataFrame, dict
        The extrema (i.e., inhalation peaks and exhalation troughs) found in
        the raw respiration channel. Must be one of the data containers
        returned by `rsp_findpeaks()`.
    desired_length : int
        By default, the returned respiratory amplitude has the same number of
        elements as inhalation peaks in `extrema`. If set to an integer, the
        returned amplitude will be interpolated between inhalation peaks over
        `desired_length` samples. Has not effect if a DataFrame is passed in as
        the `extrema` argument. In the latter case the respiratory amplitude
        will be interpolated over the entire duration of `rsp_signal`.

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing the respiratory amplitude accessible with the
        key "RSP_Amplitude"
