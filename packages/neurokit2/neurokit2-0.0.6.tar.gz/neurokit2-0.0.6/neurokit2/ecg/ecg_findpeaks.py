def ecg_findpeaks(ecg_cleaned, sampling_rate=1000, method="neurokit", show=False):
    """Find R-peaks in an ECG signal.

    Find R-peaks in an ECG signal using the specified method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ecg_cleaned : list, array or Series
        The cleaned ECG channel as returned by `ecg_clean()`.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of `ecg_signal` (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
        Defaults to 1000.
    method : string
        The algorithm to be used for R-peak detection. Defaults to "neurokit".
    show : bool
        If True, will return a plot to visualizing the thresholds used in the
        algorithm. Useful for debugging.

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of same length as the input signal in which occurences of
        R-peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros with the same length as
        `ecg_cleaned`. Accessible with the keys "ECG_Peaks".
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information, in this case the
        samples at which R-peaks occur, accessible with the key "ECG_Peaks".
