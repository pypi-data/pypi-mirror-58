    """Calculate heart rate from R-peaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : list, array, DataFrame, Series or dict
        The samples at which the R-peaks occur. If a dict or a DataFrame is
        passed, it is assumed that these containers were obtained with
        `ecg_findpeaks()`.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal that contains the R-peaks (in Hz,
        i.e., samples/second). Defaults to 1000.
    desired_length : int
        By default, the returned heart rate has the same number of elements as
        peaks. If set to an integer, the returned heart rate will be
        interpolated between R-peaks over `desired_length` samples. Has no
        effect if a DataFrame is passed in as the `peaks` argument. Defaults to
        None.

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing heart rate accessible with the key "ECG_Rate".
