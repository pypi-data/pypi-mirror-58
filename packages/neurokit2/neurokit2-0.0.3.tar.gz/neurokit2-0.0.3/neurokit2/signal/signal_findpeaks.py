    """Find peaks in a signal.

    Locate peaks (local maxima) in a signal and their related characteristics, such as height (prominence), width and distance with other peaks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : list, array or Series
        The signal channel in the form of a vector of values.

    Returns
    ----------
    array, dict
        Returns two things. An array containing the peaks indices (as relative to the given signal).
        For instance, the value 3 means that the third sample of the signal is a peak or a troughs.
        It also returns a dict itself containing 3 arrays:
            - 'Distance' contains, for each peak, the closest distance with another peak. Note that these values will be recomputed after filtering to match the selected peaks.
            - 'Height' contains the prominence of each peak. See `scipy.signal.peak_prominences()`.
            - 'Width' contains the width of each peak. See `scipy.signal.peak_widths()`.
