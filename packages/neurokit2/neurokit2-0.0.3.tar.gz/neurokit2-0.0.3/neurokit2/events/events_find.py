    """
    Find and select events based on a continuous signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    event_channel : array or list
        The channel containing the events.
    threshold : str or float
        The threshold value by which to select the events. If "auto", takes the value between the max and the min.
    threshold_keep : str
        "above" or "below", define the events as above or under the threshold. For photosensors, a white screen corresponds usually to higher values. Therefore, if your events are signaled by a black colour, events values are the lower ones, and you should set the cut to "below".
    start_at, end_at : int
        Keep events which onset is after, or before a particular time point.
    duration_min, duration_max : int
        The minimum or maximum duration of an event to be considered as such (in time points).
    inter_min : int
        The minimum duration after an event for the subsequent event to be considered as such (in time points). Useful when spurious consecutive events are created due to very high sampling rate.
    discard_first, discard_last : int
        Discard first or last n events. Useful if the experiment stats or ends with some spurious events. If discard_first=0 and discard_last=0, no first event or last event is removed.

    Returns
    ----------
    dict
        Dict containing two arrays, 'onset' for events onsets and 'duration' for events durations.
