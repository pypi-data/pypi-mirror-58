def rsp_process(rsp_signal, sampling_rate=1000):
    """Process a respiration (RSP) signal.

    Convenience function that automatically processes a respiration signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rsp_signal : list, array or Series
        The raw respiration channel (as measured, for instance, by a
        respiration belt).
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of rsp_signal (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame f same length as the input signal containing the following
        columns:

        - *"RSP_Raw"*: the raw signal.
        - *"RSP_Filtered"*: the cleaned signal.
        - *"RSP_Peaks"*: the inhalation peaks marked as "1" in a list of zeros.
        - *"RSP_Troughs"*: the exhalation troughs marked as "1" in a list of zeros.
        - *"RSP_Rate"*: breathing rate interpolated between inhalation peaks.
        - *"RSP_Period"*: the breathing period interpolated between inhalation peaks.
        - *"RSP_Amplitude"*: the breathing amplitude interpolated between inhalation peaks.
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing the samples at which inhalation peaks and
        exhalation troughs occur, accessible with the keys 'RSP_Peaks', and
        'RSP_Troughs', respectively.
