def rsp_rate(peaks, troughs=None, sampling_rate=1000, desired_length=None):
    """Calculate respiration (RSP) rate.

    Calculate respiration rate, as well as the period and amplitude.

    Parameters
    ----------
    peaks : list, array, DataFrame, Series or dict
        The samples at which the inhalation peaks occur. If a dict or a
        DataFrame is passed, it is assumed that these containers were obtained
        with `rsp_findpeaks()`.
    troughs : list, array, or Series
        The samples at which the exhalation troughs occur. Can be passed in
        individually, or is automatically inferred if peaks is a dict or
        DataFrame obtained with `rsp_findpeaks()`.
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of the signal that contains the peaks and
        troughs (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    desired_length : int
        By default, the returned respiration rate, period, and amplitude each
        have the same number of elements as peaks. If set to an integer, each
        of the returned elements will be interpolated between peaks over
        desired_length samples. Has not effect if a DataFrame is passed in as
        the peaks argument.

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame containing respiration rate, period, and amplitude,
        accessible with the keys 'RSP_Rate', 'RSP_Period' and 'RSP_Amplitude'
        respectively.
