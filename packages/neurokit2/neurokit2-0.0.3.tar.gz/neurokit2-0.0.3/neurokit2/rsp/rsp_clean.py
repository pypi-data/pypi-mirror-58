def rsp_clean(rsp_signal, sampling_rate=1000):
    """Preprocess a respiration (RSP) signal.

    This function applies linear detrending, followed by an IIR Butterworth
    lowpass filter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    rsp_signal : list, array or Series
        The raw respiration channel (as measured, for instance, by a
        respiration belt).
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of rsp_signal (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of same length as the input signal containing the raw signal
        and the cleaned signal, accessible with the keys "RSP_Raw", and
        "RSP_Filtered" respectively.
