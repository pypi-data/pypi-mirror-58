def rsp_findpeaks(rsp_filtered, sampling_rate=1000, outlier_threshold=0.3):
    """Identify extrema in a respiration (RSP) signal.

    Identifies inhalation peaks and exhalation troughs in a zero-centered
    respiration signal. The algorithm is based on (but not an exact
    implementation of) the "Zero-crossing algorithm with amplitude threshold"
    by `Khodadad et al. (2018) <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6579/aad7e6/meta>`_.


    Parameters
    ----------
    rsp_filtered : list, array or Series
        The cleaned respiration channel as returned by `rsp_clean`
    sampling_rate : int
        The sampling frequency of rsp_filtered (in Hz, i.e., samples/second).
    outlier_threshold : float
        Extrema that have a vertical distance smaller than (outlier_threshold *
        average vertical distance) to any direct neighbour are removed as
        false positive outliers. I.e., outlier_threshold should be a float with
        positive sign (the default is 0.3). Larger values of outlier_threshold correspond to more
        conservative thresholds (i.e., more extrema removed as outliers).

    Returns
    -------
    signals : DataFrame
        A DataFrame of same length as the input signal in which occurences of
        inhalation peaks and exhalation troughs marked as "1" in
        lists of zeros with the same length as rsp_filtered. Accessible with
        the keys "RSP_Peaks" and "RSP_Troughs" respectively.
    info : dict
        A dictionary containing additional information, in this case the samples
        at which inhalation peaks and exhalation troughs occur, accessible with
        the keys 'RSP_Peaks', and 'RSP_Troughs', respectively.
