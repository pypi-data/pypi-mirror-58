This is a Python package for manipulating 2-dimensional tabular data
structures (aka data frames). It is close in spirit to pandas or SFrame;
however we put specific emphasis on speed and big data support. As the
name suggests, the package is closely related to R's data.table and
attempts to mimic its core algorithms and API.
