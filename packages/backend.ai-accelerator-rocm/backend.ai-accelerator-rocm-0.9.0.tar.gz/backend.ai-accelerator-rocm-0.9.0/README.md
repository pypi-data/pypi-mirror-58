Backend.AI Accelerator Plugin for ROCm
======================================

Just install this along with Backend.AI agents, using the same virtual environment.
This will allow the agents to detect ROCm devices on their hosts and make them
available to Backend.AI kernel sessions.

```console
$ pip install -e <Path to this repository>
```

This open-source edition of ROCm plugins support allocation of one or more ROCm
devices to a container, slot-by-slot.
