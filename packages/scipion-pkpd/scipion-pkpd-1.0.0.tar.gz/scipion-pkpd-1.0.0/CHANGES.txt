March 18, 2019. First version of scipion-pkpd plugin

May, 2019. Dissolution and In-vitro In-vivo correlations module developed:
    - Fitting dissolution models: Weibull, Higuchi, Korsmeyer-Peppas,
                      Hixson-Crowell, Hopfenberg, Hill,
                      Splines2-10
    - Deconvolution of the dissolution from in vivo experiments
    - Bootstrapping of dissolution models
    - Similarity between two sets of dissolution profiles (reference and test, F1 and F2)
    - Calculation of the Levy plot
    - In vitro-In vivo correlations
    - Simulation of In vivo response using a dissolution profile and an IVIVC profile
    - Verification of the internal validity of an IVIVC
    - Importing Excel, CSV is now allowed
    - Exporting to CSV is now allowed
    - PK models can now have a spline via
    - Numerical Non-compartmental Analysis added
       This analysis does not require any fitting and it is only valid if
           the concentration observations go to zero in the long term (for instance,
           in an impulse response)

 June 2019.
 	- The simulation of PK models now keep Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, Tmax, and Tmin
 	- The Fitting viewer can now create a subset of experiments
 	- We can now perform t-tests with different number of samples
 	- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test added to verify the compatibility of two distributions
 	- Resampled dissolution profiles are generated by the F1 and F2 protocol
 	- Wagner-Nelson deconvolution is now available
 	- Comparison between sets of labels using Mahalanobis added
 	- Comparison between sets of measurements using Mahalanobis added
 	- Produce average sample added
 	- Fourier deconvolution added
 	- Bias corrected and accelerated Bootstrapping for F1 and F2
 	- Loo Riegelman deconvolution added
 	- Importing from long Excel formats added

 July 2019.
 	- F2 can now be computed according to EMA or FDA rules
 	- F1 and F2 now supports creating bootstrap experiments and calculating F1 and F2 on the dissolution profile average
 	- IVIVC can now perform power and delayed power time transformations
 	- The dissolution fit can now generate simulated profiles
 	- IVIVC Simulations can now make use of the Levy plot
 	- IVIVC internal validity now shows a plot with the true in-vivo and the simulated summaries
 	- NCA numeric now accepts a period to measure
 	- IVIVC Simulations now accepts a period to measure NCA
 	- Two experiments can now be compared visually
 	- SplinesXY added as a source for PK analysis
 	- ODE Refinement is much better and can be the input of deconvolution protocols

 August 2019.
 	- New via added: A fraction at order 0, and the rest at order 1
 	- Plots now have a white background
 	- IVIVC Internal validity has now a plot with just the median
 	- Spline parameters are printed in a sorted way
 	- Spline interpolation substituted by monotonic cubic interpolation (pchip)
 	- Compare experiments can now compare more than 2 experiments
 	- Mono and two compartments models can now be estimated by convolution (faster for long experiments)
 	- Polynomials added as pharmacodynamic models
 	- PK and PD labels can now be merged with merge_labels
 	- Data can be imported from Web Plot Digitizer CSVs
 	- IVIVC can now take any experiment for in vivo, in this way, experiments can be merged or some animals removed
 	- Double Weibull and Makoid-Banakar are now options for dissolution analysis
 	- Average samples grouping by some condition
 	- Operate experiments to add new labels or measurements

 September 2019.
 	- IVIVC with arbitrary functions added
        - IVIVC with splines added
