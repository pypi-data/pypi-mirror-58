Description: 
        CoggleECS is a small tool used to parse `.mm` files created at [coggle.it]() for ECS data. It can then output ECS data as a tree or table. It can also be used to simply show links in your map.
        
        For instance, Coggle creates links between nodes using a markdown format: `Player [#](#5d3adc) [#](#78959d)`. CoggleECS will replace those links with their respective nodes: `Player <Move,  Transform>`.
