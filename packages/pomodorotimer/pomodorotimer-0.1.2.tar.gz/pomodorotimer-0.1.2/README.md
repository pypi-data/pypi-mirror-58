Console Pomodoro timer with playing the melody of the signal or with the 
generation of an end time signal. Displays a push notification on Linux and 
Mac OS X.

Pomodoro Technique - [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

We call the program from any directory in the console and set the countdown 
time:

When the time ends, a sound signal will be played, push notification will be 
displayed and it is proposed to enter a new countdown time:

The type of push notification depends on your OS and the type of graphical 
shell used, for example:
