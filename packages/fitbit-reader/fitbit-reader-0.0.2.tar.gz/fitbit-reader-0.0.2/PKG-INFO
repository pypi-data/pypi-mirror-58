        A way to access Fitbit daily and intraday steps data.
        See `example.py` for usage.
        
        This project uses a different notion of active steps than Fitbit.
        From experience, if you are walking for nine minutes, stop for one minute 
        (say, at a traffic intersection before you are given the 'walk' prompt), and walk for
        another nine minutes, Fitbit will not register your walk as 'active'.
        This reader allows you to specify a step frequency that is considered active during a duration (the finest is minutes)
        and a number of time periods that can be inactive before ending the activity.
        
        All data returns are in Pandas dataframes.
        
        
        Setup
        -----
        
        ### Option 1: Clone the repository
        
        > Best if you want to modify or view the code - note that you can do the following inside of a virtual environment
        
            git clone https://github.com/robotpt/fitbit-reader
            
        An easy way to setup the repository with its dependencies and with your Python path
        is to use `pip`.  
        
            pip install -e fitbit-reader
        
        Tests can be run with the following commands.
            
            cd fitbit-reader
            python3 -m unittest
        
        ### Option 2: Use Pip
        
        > Best if you just want to use it
        
            python3 -m pip install fitbit_reader
