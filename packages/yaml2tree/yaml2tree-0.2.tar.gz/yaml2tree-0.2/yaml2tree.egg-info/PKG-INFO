        # yaml2tree
        Creates a tree of directories, specified using nested lists in YAML
        
        ### Usage: 
        
            [mode=XXX] [noop=1] yaml2tree <yaml-file>
        
                mode=XXX       set this env var to provide a chmod-style octal value to use as file mode
                               for the created directories.
                
                noop=1         if this env var is set, no directories are created, but the output displays
                               which ones will be created.
            
                <yaml-file>    path to YAML file containing the directory tree specification.
                               The YAML is a list of values, where every value is either a directory name
                               or a list of the same form. The YAML is processed top-down and whenever a
                               nested list is encountered, any directories in it are created inside the 
                               directory last seen on the outer list.
            
                               For example, the following definition -
                                   - foo
                                   -   - bar
                                       - baz
                                       - tam
                                   - foo1
                                   -   - bar2
                                       -   - baz3
                                   - soap
            
                               creates the following directory tree in the current working directory -
                                   foo/
                                       bar/
                                       baz/
                                       tam/
                                   foo1/
                                       bar2/
                                           baz3/
                                   soap/
