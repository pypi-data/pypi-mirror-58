        Crypto address generator from xpub
        
        
        * Free software: MIT license
        * Documentation: https://coinaddress.readthedocs.io.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        * generate addresses for multiple blockchains from extended public key (xpub)
        * minimum dependency (it means security)
        * CLI interface
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Install package using pip (prefer virtualenv):
        
            pip install coinaddress
        
        And you can start use provided CLI. Read help first:
        
            coinaddress --help
        
        To generate 1000 addresses for bitcoin xpub from file (xpub should be a single line in this file):
        
            cat xpub.txt | coinaddress bitcoin 0 -n 1000
        
        To generate another bunch of addresses:
        
            cat xpub.txt | coinaddress bitcoin 1000 -n 1000
        
        xpub can be passed with `--xpub` option but you should avoid this and prefer read from file for security reasons.
        
        Using from code
        ---------------
        
        You can use public python interface to convert addresses::
        
            from coinaddress import address_from_xpub
            address_from_xpub(
                network='bitcoin',
                xpub='<XPUB>',
                path='0/0'
            )
