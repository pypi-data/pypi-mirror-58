So:\n\n- White text on a white background will be **ignored**.\n- Subtle changes in position, size, or color of text will be **detected**.\n- This program will ignore changes caused by a different version of the PDF generator, or by invisible changes in the source document.\n\nThis is in contrast to most other tools, which tend to extract the text stream out of a PDF, and then diff those texts. Such tools include:\n\n- `pdf-diff <https://github.com/JoshData/pdf-diff>`_ by Joshua Tauberer\n\nThere seem to be some tools similar to the one you\'re looking at now, although I have experience with none of these:\n\n- Václav Slavík seems to have `an open source one <https://github.com/vslavik/diff-pdf>`_\n- There might be more useful ones mentioned on `this SuperUser thread <https://superuser.com/questions/46123/how-to-compare-the-differences-between-two-pdf-files-on-windows>`_\n\nThe strength of this script is that it\'s simple to use on the command line, and it\'s easy to reuse in scripts:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from diff_pdf_visually import pdfdiff\n\n    # Returns True or False\n    pdfdiff("a.pdf", "b.pdf")\n\nOr use it from the command line:\n\n.. code-block:: shell\n\n    $ pip3 install --user diff-pdf-visually\n    $ diff-pdf-visually a.pdf b.pdf\n\n\nHow to install this\n===================\n\nYou can install this tool with ``pip3``, but we need the ImageMagick and Poppler programs.\n\nOn Ubuntu Linux\n---------------\n\n1.  ``sudo apt update``\n2.  ``sudo apt install python3-pip imagemagick poppler-utils``\n3.  ``pip3 install --user diff-pdf-visually``\n4.  If this is the first time that you ``pip3 install --user`` something, then log out totally from Linux and log in again. (This is to refresh the ``PATH``.)\n5.  Run with ``diff-pdf-visually``.\n\nOn Mac with Homebrew (untested)\n-------------------------------\n\n1.  Run ``brew install poppler imagemagick``.\n2.  ``pip3 install --user diff-pdf-visually``\n3.  If this is the first time that you ``pip3 install --user`` something, then close your terminal and open a new one. (This is to refresh the ``PATH``.)\n4.  Run with ``diff-pdf-visually``.\n\nOn Windows Subsystem for Linux\n------------------------------\n\nI\'ve never tried but I think this will work. Give it a go and let me know (at bram at bram dot xyz) if it worked! Unfortunately it takes quite a while to get everything installed.\n\n1. Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and Ubuntu 18.04, for instance `with this tutorial <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10>`_\n\n2. Initialize Ubuntu 18.04 (`tutorial <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/initialize-distro>`_)\n\n3. Now proceed with the Ubuntu Linux instructions.\n\nLet me know (at bram at bram dot xyz) if this worked!\n\nOn Windows native\n-----------------\n\nLars Olafsson suggested that the following might work:\n\n- Install ``diff-pdf-visually`` via Pip.\n- Install ImageMagick, e.g. via https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php\n- Download pdftocairo/Poppler, e.g. the old Windows build produced by Todd Hubers and Ilya Kitaev: https://blog.alivate.com.au/poppler-windows/ . Extract the .7z file somewhere and update the Windows ``Path`` variable to add the ``bin`` folder that was extracted.\n- Run ``diff-pdf-visually``.\n\nHow it works\n============\n\nWe use ``pdftocairo`` to convert both PDFs to a series of PNG images in a temporary directory. The number of pages and the dimensions of the page must be exactly the same. Then we call ``compare`` from ImageMagick to check how similar they are; if one of the pages compares different above a certain threshold, then the PDFs are reported as different, otherwise they are reported the same.\n\n**You must have ImageMagick and poppler already installed**.\n\nCall ``diff-pdf-visually`` without parameters (or run ``python3 -m diff_pdf_visually``) to see its command line arguments. Import it as ``diff_pdf_visually`` to use its functions from Python.\n\nThere are some options that you can use either from the command line or from Python::\n\n    $ diff-pdf-visually  -h\n    usage: diff-pdf-visually [-h] [--silent] [--verbose] [--threshold THRESHOLD]\n                             [--dpi DPI] [--time TIME]\n                             a.pdf b.pdf\n\n    Compare two PDFs visually. The exit code is 0 if they are the same, and 2 if\n    there are significant differences.\n\n    positional arguments:\n      a.pdf\n      b.pdf\n\n    optional arguments:\n      -h, --help            show this help message and exit\n      --silent, -q          silence output (can be used only once)\n      --verbose, -v         show more information (can be used 2 times)\n      --threshold THRESHOLD\n                            PSNR threshold to consider a change significant,\n                            higher is more sensitive (default: 100)\n      --dpi DPI             resolution for the rasterised files (default: 50)\n      --time TIME           number of seconds to wait before discarding temporary\n                            files, or 0 to immediately discard\n\nThese "temporary files" include a PNG image of where any differences are, per page, as well as the log output of ImageMagick. If you want to get a feeling for thresholds, there are some example PDFs in the ``tests/`` directory.\n\nThere is also an environment variable:\n\n- ``COMPARE``: override the path of ImageMagick compare. By default, we try first ``compare`` and then ``magick compare`` (for Windows).\n\nSo what do you use this for?\n============================\n\nPersonally, I\'ve used this a couple of times to refactor my LaTeX documents: I just simplify or remove some macro definitions, and if nothing changes, apparently it\'s safe to make that change.\n\nStatus\n======\n\nAt the moment, this program/module works best for finding *whether* two PDFs are visually different.\n\nThis project is licenced under the MIT licence. It will not work on Python 2.\n\n',
