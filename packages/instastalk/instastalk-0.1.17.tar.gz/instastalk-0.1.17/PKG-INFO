Description: # instastalk
        Instastalk is a library initiated by a creep who develops massive crush to instagram celebrities and wishes to automate the process of backing up their photos.
        
        ## How to use
        `pip install instastalk`
        ```python
        from instastalk import (
            AnonyStalker,
            InstaStalker,
        )
        
        # no auth - only public posts (no stories)
        stalker = AnonyStalker()
        stalker.download_user('jjkoh95', timesleep_factor=45) # will need to create a directory 'jjkoh95'
        stalker.to_pickle('anony.pkl')
        
        # with auth
        login_stalker = InstaStalker('your_username', 'your_password')
        login_stalker.download_user('jjkoh95', timesleep_factor=45)
        login_stalker.to_pickle('user.pkl')
        
        # to continue last download
        import pickle
        with open('user.pkl', 'rb') as f:
            s: InstaStalker = pickle.load(f)
        s.download_user('jjkoh95')
        ```
