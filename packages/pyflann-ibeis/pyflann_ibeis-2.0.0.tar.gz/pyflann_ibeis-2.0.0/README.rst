This is a Fork of the FLANN repo, under a different name for use in the IBEIS
project. The main difference is that it has a few more helper function calls
and it should be easier build wheels and to pip install.


FLANN - Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
======================================================

FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of algorithms we found to work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically choosing the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset.
FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following languages: C, MATLAB, Python, and Ruby.


Documentation
-------------

Check FLANN web page [here](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann).

Documentation on how to use the library can be found in the doc/manual.pdf file included in the release archives.

More information and experimental results can be found in the following paper:
