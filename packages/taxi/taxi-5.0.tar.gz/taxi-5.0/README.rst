What is Taxi ?
==============

Taxi is a timesheeting tool that focuses on simplicity to help you write your
timesheets without wasting time. All you'll do is edit a text file and write
down what you've worked on and how long, like so::

    23/01/2014

    pingpong 09:00-10:00 Play ping-pong
    infra         -11:00 Repair coffee machine

You can then get a summary of your timesheet::

    Staging changes :

    # Thursday 23 january #
    pingpong (123/456)             1.00  Play ping-pong
    infra (123/42)                 1.00  Repair coffee machine
                                   2.00

    Total                          2.00

    Use `taxi ci` to commit staging changes to the server

Through the use of backends, Taxi allows you to push your timesheets to
different systems.

Installation & usage
====================

The recommended way to install Taxi is by running the following command::

    pip install --user taxi

You'll probably want to install a backend too, that will allow you to push your timesheets. To install the Zebra
backend for example::

    pip install --user taxi-zebra

You can now try to run the ``taxi`` command. If you're getting a "command not found" error, make sure that
`~/.local/bin/` is in your ``PATH`` environment variable (eg. by running ``echo $PATH``). To change your ``PATH``
environment variable, you can follow `this guide <https://stackoverflow.com/a/14638025>`_.

Everything else is covered in the user documentation available on Read The Docs:
