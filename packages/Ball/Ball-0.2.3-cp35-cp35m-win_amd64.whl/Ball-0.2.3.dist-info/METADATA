Ball Statistics
================

Introduction
------------
The fundamental problems for data mining and statistical analysis are:

-  Whether distributions of two samples are distinct?

-  Whether two random variables are dependent?

**Ball** package provides solutions for these issues. Moreover, a
variable screening (or feature screening) procedure is also implemented
to tackle ultra high dimensional data. The core functions in **Ball**
package are **bd_test**, **bd**, **bcov_test**, **bcov**, **bcorsis** and
**bcor**.

These functions based on ball statistic have several advantages:

-  It's applicable to univariate and multivariate data in Banach space.

-  There is no need for moment assumption, which means that outliers and
   heavy-tail data are no longer a problem.

-  They perform well in many setting without complex adjustments for
   parameters.

Particularly, for two-sample or K-sample problem, **bd_test** has been
proved to cope well for imbalanced data, and **bcov_test** and
**bcorsis** work well for detecting the relationship between complex
responses and/or predictors, such as shape, compositional as well as
censored data.

Install instructions
--------------------
We recommend that compile C++ files by gcc instead of Visual Studio.
You could download MinGW (https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/) and then
add the path ``MinGW/bin`` to system environment variable "path".

Anaconda3 is needed, and the version should be greater than 3.4. You should 
add all the related path of Anaconda3 to system environment variable "path",
as well as the path of ``MinGW/bin``.

Then you can pip install the Ball package!
