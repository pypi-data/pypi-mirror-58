'''
Financial data plotter with better defaults, api, behavior and performance than
mpl_finance and plotly.

Lines up your time-series with a shared X-axis; ideal for volume, RSI, etc.

Zoom does something similar to what you'd normally expect for financial data,
where the Y-axis is auto-scaled to highest high and lowest low in the active
region.
