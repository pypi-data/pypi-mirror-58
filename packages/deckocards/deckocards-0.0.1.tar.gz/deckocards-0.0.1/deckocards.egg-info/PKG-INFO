Description: # Deck of Cards
        A basic card and deck class for playing around with cards. Cards are objects that have suits and numbers, with an id consisting of the number plus the first letter of the suit. Decks are arrays of card objects with some basic methods.  
        #
        # Getting Started
        All you need to do is
        
        >pip install deckocards
        
        and then you are done.
        
        ### Prerequisites
        You need:
        - Python 3 (preferably 3.6 and above)
        - pip package manager
        
        ## Tests
        There are automated tests built into the deck class. Simply run the **deck.py** file. This tests ensures that the card and deck objects are functioning.
