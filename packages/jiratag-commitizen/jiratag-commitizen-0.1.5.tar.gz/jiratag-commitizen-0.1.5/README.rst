====================
Jiratag Commitizen
====================

This a simple project forked from https://Woile.github.io/commitizen/
that simply adds a step in the default conventional-commit pipeline to
indicate the Jira Issue tag in order for the commit to include the link
to the issue so that is quickly accessed from the Bitbucket commit log.
