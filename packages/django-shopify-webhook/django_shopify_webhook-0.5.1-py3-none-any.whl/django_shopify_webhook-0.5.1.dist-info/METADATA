Django Shopify Webhook
======================

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/django-shopify-webhook.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/py/django-shopify-webhook)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/discolabs/django-shopify-webhook.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/discolabs/django-shopify-webhook)

This Django package aims to make it easy to add webhook-handling behaviour into
your Django app. It provides:

- A `WebhookView` for catching and verifying webhooks sent from Shopify, and
  triggering the appropriate webhook signal.

- `webhook`, `carrier_request` and `app_proxy` view decorators that validate
  these various types of request.

- A number of `WebhookSignal`s that can be listened to and handled by your
  application.

**Note:** This package is no longer actively developed and I'm unable to provide
support for it. I am happy to review and accept pull requests from anyone who's
using it in their own applications.
