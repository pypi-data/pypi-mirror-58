# Pelican Series: A Plugin for Pelican

This plugin extends the original series plugin by [FELD Boris <lothiraldan@gmail.com>](https://github.com/Lothiraldan)
Copyright (c) [Leonardo Giordani <giordani.leonardo@gmail.com>](https://github.com/TheDigitalCatOnline)
This plugin is also in the [Pelican Plugins repository](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins)

The series plugin allows you to join different posts into a series.

In order to mark posts as part of a series, use the `:series:` metadata:

    :series:  NAME_OF_THIS_SERIES

or, in Markdown syntax

    Series: NAME_OF_THIS_SERIES

The plugin collects all articles belonging to the same series and provides
series-related variables that you can use in your template.

## Indexing

By default articles in a series are ordered by date and then automatically numbered.

If you want to force a given order just specify the `:series_index:` metadata or in Markdown `series_index:`,
starting from 1. All articles with this enforced index are put at the beginning of
the series and ordered according to the index itself. All the remaining articles
come after them, ordered by date.

The plugin provides the following variables to your templates

    * `article.series.name` is the name of the series as specified in the article metadata
    * `article.series.index` is the index of the current article inside the series
    * `article.series.all` is an ordered list of all articles in the series (including the current one)
    * `article.series.all_previous` is an ordered list of the articles published before the current one
    * `article.series.all_next` is an ordered list of the articles published after the current one
    * `article.series.previous` is the previous article in the series (a shortcut to `article.series.all_previous[-1]`)
    * `article.series.next` is the next article in the series (a shortcut to `article.series.all_next[0]`)

For example:

    {% if article.series %}
        <p>This post is part {{ article.series.index }} of the "{{ article.series.name }}" series:</p>
        <ol class="parts">
            {% for part_article in article.series.all %}
                <li {% if part_article == article %}class="active"{% endif %}>
                    <a href='{{ SITEURL }}/{{ part_article.url }}'>{{ part_article.title }}</a>
                </li>
            {% endfor %}
        </ol>
    {% endif %}


Joins articles in a series and provides variables to manage the series in the template.
