# A small ssh list tool
## Background
I need a light-weight tool to list the servers that can be connected via ssh. However, I find no one. Therefore, I create it.

It's only a small tool.

## Principle
Read configration from `$HOME/.ssh/config`.

## Installation

```python
pip install tobe
```

## Usages
```bash
]# tobe
```
