!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
! Important arrays:
! pred_last:    (n_atoms) array,
!               y_pred values from last layer,
!               previouslly cannot be (n_atoms) as atom ids are not continuous
!               currently should fill the lost values as 0
!
! neigh_voro:   (n_atoms, n_neighs) array,
!               neighbor_list by Voronoi,
!               should deal with the lost atoms due to removing boundaries
!               currently should fill the lost values as 0
!
! probs:        (n_probs) array/list,
!               probs used as prob_thresholds
!
! features_new: (n_atoms, n_features) array,
!               new features returned
