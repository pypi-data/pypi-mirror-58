Description: # koogle - Google Search Results Scraper
        
        A simple utility to get Google Search Results, including Ad results that appear at top of page or bottom of page, as lists of dictionaries. 
        
        Since it based on the div tags classes used by Google, it is fragile and will be need to be updated as and when
        Google makes changes to the results page html.
        
        Be respectful to Gods of Google and include delay of 30-180 seconds between consequent calls to this utility.
