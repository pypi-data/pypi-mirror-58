libexe is a library to access the executable (EXE) format.

At the moment the goal of this project is to provide functionality to parse EXE (PE/COFF) and the resources stored in them using libwrc.
This functionality is used in libevt and libevx to parse EventLog messages from PE/COFF message files.
