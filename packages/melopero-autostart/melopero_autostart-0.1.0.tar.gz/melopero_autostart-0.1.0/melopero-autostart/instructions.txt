melopero-autostart instructions 

To run a python script at startup you have to put it in the scripts directory:

/home/melopero-autostart/scripts/

For each script in this directory a log file will be created and the script 
will print out to this file. The output to the file is unbuffered (be careful
with print statements, they  may slow down your process). 
Each script will be run in background in a separate shell with superuser privileges.
