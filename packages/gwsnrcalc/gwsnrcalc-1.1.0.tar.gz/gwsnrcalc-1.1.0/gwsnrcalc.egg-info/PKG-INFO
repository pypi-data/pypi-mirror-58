        ``gwsnrcalc`` is a package designed for fast signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) calculations for single gravitational wave sources using a matched filtering SNR approach. It was originally designed to support `BOWIE`_ for `Evaluating Black Hole Detectability with LISA` (`arXiv:1807.02511`_). It provides a fast SNR calculator, frequency-domain amplitude waveforms for binary black holes, and a SNR grid generator for binary black holes.

        The main snr function is ``gwsnrcalc.gw_snr_calculator.snr``. It has the capability to perform calculations in parallel across processors for faster calculation.
        
        The waveform generator (``gwsnrcalc.utils.waveforms``) creates either circular or eccentric waveforms.
        
        Circular waveforms are created with PhenomD amplitude waveforms for binary black hole inspiral, merger, and ringdown. PhenomD is from Husa et al 2016 (`arXiv:1508.07250`_) and Khan et al 2016 (`arXiv:1508.07253`_). The current waveforms returned are in units of characteristic strain.
        
        Eccentric waveforms are generated according to Peters evolution only for the inspiral phase.

        .. _arXiv:1508.07253: https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07253
        
        The snr grid generator: ``gwsnrcalc.generate_contour_data`` uses ``gwsnrcalc.gw_snr_calculator.snr`` to create SNR grids for contour plots (like those used in BOWIE).
        
        Available via pip and on github: https://github.com/mikekatz04/BOWIE/
        
        Getting Started
        ===============
        
        These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for usage and testing purposes.
        
        Prerequisites
        =============
        
        It is best to run out of conda environment. It will handle the dependencies better. If you have issues with certain modules, try to update them.
        
        Software installation/usage only requires a few specific libraries in python. All libraries are included with Anaconda. If you do not run python in an anaconda environment, you  will need the following libraries and modules to run with all capabilities: Numpy, Scipy, collections, sys, json, multiprocessing, datetime, time, astropy, and h5py. All can be installed with pip. For example, within your python environment of choice:
        
        ``pip install astropy``
        
        In order to properly create waveforms with ctypes, you will need complex, gsl, and math c libraries. For installing gsl, refer to https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ or install it through anaconda.
        
        Installation
        =============
        
        Begin with updating conda:
          ``conda update conda``
        
        Create a conda environment (change the name as desired. Default: gwsnr_env):
          ``conda create -n gwsnr_env numpy scipy astropy h5py gsl matplotlib jupyter ipython python=3.7``
        
        Installation is done two ways:
        
        1) using pip
        
          ``pip install gwsnrcalc``
        
          This will download the all necessary packages to your current environment. It will not download the notebooks for testing and example usage.
        
        2) Clone the git repo on the command line, or downloading it from github. This is for all the modules, example jupyter notebooks, and extra files. This method will include BOWIE if pip install is used on the outer directory. To just download specific files that do not come with pip (e.g. jupyter notebook with examples), just download the files from the github.
        
          a) navigate to the directory of your choice.
        
          b) clone the git repo on the command line.
        
            ``git clone https://github.com/mikekatz04/BOWIE.git``
        
          c) pip install the local code to add the modules to your environment and compile the c codes.
        
            ``pip install ./BOWIE/snr_calculator_folder/``
        
        Testing and Running an Example
        ==============================
        
        To test the codes, you run the guide notebook.
        
        ``jupyter notebook pyphenomd_guide.ipynb``
