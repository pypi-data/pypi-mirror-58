Description: # sparse_dot_mkl
        
        This is a wrapper for the sparse matrix multiplication in the intel MKL library.
        It is implemented entirely in native python using `ctypes`.
        The main advantage to MKL (which motivated this) is multithreaded sparse matrix multiplication. 
        The scipy sparse implementation is single-threaded at the time of writing (2020-01-03).
        
        The only function explicitly available is `dot_product_mkl`, which takes two CSR or CSC sparse matrices
        `dot_product_mkl(A, B)` and produces a CSR or CSC matrix that is `A (dot) B`. 
        
        This only does floating point data, and both matrices must be identical types.
        If `cast=True` non-float matrices will be converted to doubles,
        and a single-precision matrix will be promoted to doubles unless both matrices are single-precision. 
        `cast=True` will change data in-place. This function may also reorder the underlying data structures
        without warning while creating MKL's internal matrix representation.
        
        This package requires `libmkl_rt.so`. This is distributed with the full version of conda,
        and can be installed into Miniconda with `conda install -c intel mkl`.
        Alternatively, you may add need to add the path to MKL shared objects to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
        (e.g. `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`).
