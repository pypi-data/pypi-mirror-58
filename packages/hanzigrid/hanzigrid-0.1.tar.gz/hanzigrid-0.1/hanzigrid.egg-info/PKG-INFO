Description: Hanzi Grid Tool
        ====================
        
        This is the command line tool that generated the above chinese character study grids, and with which you can create your
        own study grids.
        
        * **SVG images** - great for printing, making your own chinese character poster and hanging it on your wall!
        * **An interactive HTML page** (using the SVG images - for study on computers or mobile devices. There's also
          Javascript/JSON output which you can immediately reuse in your own applications.
        
        The tool is fed a list of input characters (a plain text file), and it will look up each character in HSK level 1 to 6
        and draw it on the grid along with additional information. This means you can use it to generate custom grids with
        exactly the characters **you** want and in the order you want.
        
        Features
        --------------
        
        * Characters can be assigned a colour corresponding to the tone (1 - red, 2 - yellow, 3 - green, 4 - blue). Characters that
          have multiple readings, are neutral tone, or for which no pinyin could be found (if they're not in HSK) are always shown in black.
        * HSK levels can be indicated by cell background colour (HSK1-3: white, HSK4: light grey; HSK5: yellow, HSK6: red, not
          in HSK: dark grey).  This may act as a cue for you to skip the character until you're proficient in the lowel levels.
        * Example words from the HSK lexicon are shown (up to two in the images). In the interactive form, click a character words in which they occur.
        * Showing pinyin on the grid is supported (but not enabled by default)
        * Pinyin ordering is supported (not enabled by default)
        * The alternative character (simlified/traditional) can be shown in the bottom-right corner of the cell.
        * You can determines the columns/rows/cell sizes.
