# Python BRfied

Why I create sc4net?
To avoid code's copy and paste codes to user requests and requests_ftp.
This are a many of code shortcuts that I used many times.
And, because I wanna use the same function to HTTP(S) and FTP.


# sc4net

## Network sync

* get - Get HTTP and FTP content as decoded String 
* get_json - Get HTTP and FTP as JSON
* get_zip - Get HTTP and FTP as ZipFile
* get_zip_content - Get first (by default) HTTP and FTP file content in a ZipFile
* get_zip_csv_content - Get first (by default) HTTP and FTP file content in a ZipFile as iterable CSV (comma-separated values file)
