This is the nester.py module

It provides one function called print_lol() which prints lists that may or may not include nested lists.
 
This function takes a positional argument called 'the_list', which is any Python list (of, possibly, nested lists). Each data item in the provided list is (recursively) printed to the screen on its own line.

Constructed by John Baxter via Head First Python, O'Reilly, Paul Barry.
