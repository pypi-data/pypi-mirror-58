        Guidelines
        ----------
        
        Please contact the [PixelForest Dev Team](devteam@pixelforest.io) for
        any bug report or feature request.
        
        Publish to PyPi
        ---------------
        If you are not yet inside your virtual environment, activate it
        ```shell script
          source venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        First, generate the new distributions archives (you need `setuptools` and `wheel` installed).
        ```shell script
          python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        ```
        
        Then, after testing it locally, upload it directly to PyPi. You'll need the credentials of the pixelforest PyPi user for this operation.
        ```shell script
          twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
        ```
