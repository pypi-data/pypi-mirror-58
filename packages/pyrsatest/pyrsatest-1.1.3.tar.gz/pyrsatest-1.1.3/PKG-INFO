Description: **Pyramid SQLAlchemy unit testing utilities**
        
        A package which provides a set of utilities that enables SQLAlchemy functionality to be
        mocked in the writing of unit tests for a Pyramid application.
        
        The package was created for situations where it is desirable to mock out the database
        layer, such as in cases where its complexity makes test setup overly time-consuming.
        It is suited to unit testing applications which use SQLAlchemy as an ORM.
        
        In particular [Pyramid](https://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/latest/) applications, 
        a framework within which models have no direct awareness of the database and database 
        interactions are carried out through `request.dbsession`.
