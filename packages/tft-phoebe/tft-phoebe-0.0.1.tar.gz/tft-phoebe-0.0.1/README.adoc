= Phoebe

Phoebe is a data gathering proxy for https://prometheus.io/[Prometheus] toolkit. Its goal is to gather metrics from systems that don't provide their own native Prometheus export, and make them available for digestion by Prometheus.


== How to run an exporter

[source,shell]
....
$ poetry install
$ poetry run phoebe-openstack --config=<your config file> --export=<filepath or - for stdout>
....

Or, without using Poetry at all, using PyPI package:

[source,shell]
....
$ pip install ... # as soon as we publish it, I 'm going to fix the package name
$ phoebe-openstack --config=<your config file> --export=<filepath or - for stdout>
....
