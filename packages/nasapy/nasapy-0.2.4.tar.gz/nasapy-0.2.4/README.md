Python wrapper for the [nasa.gov API](https://api.nasa.gov/).

## Installation

`nasapy` is most easily installed using `pip`.

```bash
pip install nasapy
```

The library can also be cloned or downloaded into a location of your choosing and then installed using the `setup.py` 
file per the following:

~~~ bash
git clone git@github.com:aschleg/nasapy.git
cd nasapy
python setup.py install
~~~

## Documentation

* [nasapy Documentation](https://nasapy.readthedocs.io/)
* [Nasa's API documentation page](https://api.nasa.gov/)

## Requirements

* Python 3.4+
* `requests>=2.18`
* `pandas>=0.22.0`
  - Although not strictly required to use `nasapy`, the [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) library is needed 
    for returning results as a DataFrame.

## Tutorials and In-Depth Examples

The following are Jupyter Notebooks that explore a facet of the `nasapy` library in more depth. The notebooks can 
also be launched interactively with binder by clicking the "launch binder" badge above.

## Examples and Usage

Although not strictly required to begin interacting with the NASA API, it is recommended to sign up 
to receive an [API access key](https://api.nasa.gov/) that has a significantly higher usage limit available compared 
to the demo key option. Many methods do not require an API key, but for those that do, it is typically a good option to 
use a provided API key rather than the demo key. Using a received API key allows for 1,000 requests per hour, while the 
demo key has 30 requests limit per hour and 50 requests per day.

### Authentication

Assuming an API key was received after signing up, authentication to the NASA API happens when initializing the `Nasa` 
class.

~~~ python
nasa = Nasa(key=key)
~~~  

If using a demo key, the initialization does not require any parameters to be passed.

~~~ python
nasa = Nasa()
~~~

### Remaining Requests Available

The `limit_remaining` attribute of the initialized `Nasa` class allows one to see the number of available requests 
remaining.

~~~ python
nasa.limit_remaining
~~~

### Examples

The following are some quick examples to get started.

#### Astronomy Picture of the Day

~~~ python
# Return today's picture of the day
nasa.picture_of_the_day()

~~~ python
# Get imagery at latitude 1.5, longitude 100.75 and include the computed cloud score calculation.
nasa.earth_imagery(lon=100.75, lat=1.5, cloud_score=True)

# Get assets available beginning from 2014-02-01 at lat-lon 100.75, 1.5
nasa.earth_assets(lat=100.75, lon=1.5, begin_date='2014-02-01')
