        =======================
        
        |Build Status|
        
        CppHeaderParser is a pure python C++ header parser that parses C++
        headers and creates a data structure that you can use to do many types
        of things. We’ve found it particularly useful for creating programs that
        generate python wrappers around existing C++ programs.
        
        robotpy-cppheaderparser is a fork of the `CppHeaderParser`_ library
        originally created by @senex. CppHeaderParser is an excellent library
        and critical to some of the stuff we do in the RobotPy project.
        Unfortunately, the maintainer seems to be busy, so
        robotpy-cppheaderparser was born.
        
        We don’t currently intend to develop new features, but aim to maintain
        compatibility with the existing code and make improvements and bugfixes
        as we need them.
        
        If you find an bug, we encourage you to submit a pull request! New
        changes will only be accepted if there are tests to cover the change you
        made (and if they don’t break existing tests).
