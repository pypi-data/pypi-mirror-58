=====
PyPDE
=====

A Python library for solving any system of hyperbolic or parabolic Partial
Differential Equations. The PDEs can have stiff source terms and
non-conservative components.

Key Features:

* Any first or second order system of PDEs
* Your fluxes and sources are written in Python for ease
* Any number of spatial dimensions
* Arbitrary order of accuracy
* C++ under the hood for speed
* Based on the ADER-WENO method
