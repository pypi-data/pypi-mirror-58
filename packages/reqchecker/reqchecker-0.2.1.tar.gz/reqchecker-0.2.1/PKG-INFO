        Compare python package requirements across packages by reading the specified requirements files.
        
        
        Install
        --------
        Clone this repository::
        
          $ git clone https://github.com/robertson-mark/reqchecker
        
        Install::
        
          $ python setup.py install
        
        
        Usage
        --------
        reqchecker gathers requirements by using a ``.json`` file formatted as::
        
            {
              "default": {
                "source": {"package": "path",
                           "package": "path"}
                        },
        
              "my-home": {
                "source": {"package": "path",
                           "package": "path"}
                        },
        
              "my-github": {
                "github": {"package": "branch",
                           "package": "branch",
                           "package": "branch"},
                "credentials": "<path_to_credentials.json>"
                        }
            }
        
        A ``default`` field is required, additional sections, in this case ``my-local`` and ``my-github`` can be added and called from the command line.
        
        - ``source`` can be 'local' or 'github'
        
          | If 'local', must supply 'path' to repository
          | If 'github', must also include 'credentials' and path to a credentials.json file
        
        The credentials.json file looks like::
        
            {
              "user": "github_user",
              "token": "github_token"
            }
        
        
        To use by calling the ``"defaults"`` section::
        
          $ reqchecker
        
        To change the section to read from the saved settings in ``"my-home"``::
        
          $ reqchecker --section my-home
        
        The user can also overwrite sections by including --packages and --locations with the ``my-home`` option, and --packages and --branches with the ``github`` option.
        
        To call using a different .json than is in this repository::
        
          $ reqcheckert --file <file>
