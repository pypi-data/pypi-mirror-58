        Manageacloud is a flexible orchestration platform. It allows you to create, destroy and organise servers and infrastructures.
        
        Fork me on `GitHub <https://github.com/manageacloud/manageacloud-cli>`_!
        
        Features
        --------
        - Orchestrate servers
        - Orchestrate production ready infrastructure (golden images, autoscaling groups, load balancers, etc)
        - Versioning servers and infrastructure
        - Empower Continuous Delivery
        - View who is the owner of the resources (servers and infrastructure)
        - Interact with your servers using a Command Line Interface, REST Api or Web Interface
        - Manage access to servers
        - Convert your infrastructure into code
        - Orchestrate servers using your existing automation codes (eg Docker, Puppet, Chef, SaltStack, etc)
        - Test server configurations easily
        - Integrate any technology that can be operated from the command line interface or an API
        - Keep the history (including logs) of servers and infrastructure
        - Trigger events via WebHooks
        - Although Manageacloud is technology agnostic, we have created some shortcuts for easier operation with Amazon Web Services, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace and Digital Ocean

        Examples
        ========
        
        Standalone applications
        -----------------------
        
        To create a new server and install apache for Ubuntu
        
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            mac instance create -b "apt-get update && apt-get install apache2 -y" -r ubuntu:trusty
        
        To create a new server and install apache for CentOS
        
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            mac instance create -b "apt-get update && apt-get install apache2 -y" -r centos:7
        
        
        To install Wordpress
        
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            mac instance create -c basic_wordpress_installation
        
        Infrastructures
        ---------------
        
        You can learn more about how to orchestrate infrastructure using our [quickstart guide](https://manageacloud.com/quickstart)
        
        The following example:
         - Creates an instance and a load balancer in AWS
         - Deploys an application and version *version_2*
        
        This infrastructure has a *name* and a *version*, which makes it ideal for some scenarios such as blue-green deployments.
        
        .. sourcecode:: bash
        
            mac -s infrastructure macfile https://goo.gl/ezRWx1 -p INF_VERSION=2 APP_BRANCH=version_2
