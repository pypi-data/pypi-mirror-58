# PieFish

PieFish is a 2D graphics API that mimics the Processing API.

## Installation

1. [Download the repository as a .zip file.](https://github.com/pb2002/PyVis/archive/master.zip)  
OR use pip to install it from PyPI (and skip all other installation steps, unless you want to try out the example):

    ```Terminal
    pip install piefish
    ```

2. Make sure you've got all of the required pip packages installed:
    * pygame
    * colorama

## How to use

### Main script setup

First of all, you need to import piefish:

```Python
    import piefish
```

Note: since all functions for drawing are part of the piefish namespace, you might
want to use `import piefish as pf` instead.

After that, you can initialize PieFish by calling the 'init()' method:

```Python
    piefish.init()
```

The nice thing about PieFish is that the update loop is already setup for you.
The only thing you need to do is add your functions to the update loop by adding them
to a _function pool_.

_Function pools_ are lists of functions that get called
at a certain point in the kernel loop. For example, the _"draw"-pool_ gets called
every frame, whilst the _"setup"-pool_ only gets called at the start of the program.

You can add functions to a function pool as follows:

```Python
@piefish.kernel.pool("draw", 1)
def yourFunction():
    # Do something

```

The number after the name of the draw pool indicates the priority of that function in the pool.
Functions with a higher priority will be executed before others.

To start the kernel loop, add this line at the end of your main script:

```Python
piefish.kernel.run()
```

Your final script should look like this:

```Python
import piefish as pf

pf.init()

@pf.kernel.pool("setup",1)
def onSetup():
    # do something

@pf.kernel.pool("draw",1)
def onDraw():
    # do something

pf.kernel.run()
```

All functionality is included in the example, and you can use it as a reference to create your
own application.
