Description: ====
        Setl
        ====
        
        Setl (pronounced like *settle*) is a simple way to work with PEP 518 projects
        with Setuptools as the backend.
        
        The interface is strongly influenced by Flit_. Currently a proof of concept.

        Usage
        =====
        
        1. Create a project with appropriate ``setup.py`` and/or ``setup.cfg`` metadata
           declarations.
        
        2. Create ``pyproject.toml`` and provide the needed `PEP 518`_ definitions. An
           empty file is sufficient if you want to use the default values.
        
        3. Run this command to upload your code to PyPI (using ``--python`` to
           specify the Python to build the package against)::
        
                setl --python path/to/python publish
        
        .. _`PEP 518`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/
        
        
        Miscellaneous
        =============
        
        To install a package locally for development, run::
        
            setl --python path/to/python develop
        
        All *build* commands are available via ``setl build``::
        
            setl --python path/to/python build [--ext] [--py] [--clib] [--scripts]
        
        To create package distributions (equivalent to ``flit build``), use::
        
            setl --python path/to/python dist [--source] [--wheel]
