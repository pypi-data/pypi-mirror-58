Setl
====

Setl (pronounced like *settle*) is a simple way to work with PEP 518 projects
with Setuptools as the backend.

The interface is strongly influenced by Flit_. Currently a proof of concept.

.. _Flit: https://flit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/


Usage
=====

1. Create a project with appropriate ``setup.py`` and/or ``setup.cfg`` metadata
   declarations.

2. Create ``pyproject.toml`` and provide the needed `PEP 518`_ definitions. An
   empty file is sufficient if you want to use the default values.

3. Run this command to upload your code to PyPI::

        setl publish

.. _`PEP 518`: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0518/

Miscellaneous
=============

To install a package locally for development, run::

    setl develop --python path/to/python

All *build* commands are available via ``setl build``::

    setl build --python path/to/python [--ext] [--py] [--clib] [--scripts]

To create package distributions (equivalent to ``flit build``), use::

    setl dist --python path/to/python [--source] [--wheel]
