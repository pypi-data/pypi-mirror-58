# fsva - FuseSoc Verification Automation

## Introduction

FuseSoc Verification Automation (fsva) is a tool that aims to automate the verification process of libraries and HDL design projects managed with [FuseSoc](https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc) build tool/system.

fsva in no way duplicates or replaces functionalities provided by the FuseSoc.
Colloquially speaking, fsva is a wrapper for FuseSoc, automating the verification process.

### Why?
The major goal is to easy integrate project/libraries described in FuseSoc into Continuous Integration workflow.
FuseSoc is more than good for building and running single targets, however if you want to run multiple verificaiton targets it keeps rebuilding verification frameworks.
This particular operation is redundant and time consuming.
fsva assumes that verification frameworks (such as [UVVM](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM) or [OSVVM](https://github.com/OSVVM/OSVVM)) are already pre-compiled (pre-analyzed) for simulation engines.
What is more, fsva extends FuseSoc by parsing verification results.

## How it works
fsva scans recursively for `.core` files and fetches all targets starting with `tb_` or ending with `_tb`.
Then it runs these targets calling FuseSoc run command and captures stdout and stderr.
All verification results, as well as verification summary, are saved as separate files in a directory, which name reflects the UTC time of a verification process startup.

If any extra parsing of the verification results is needed (for example in case of metric driven verification) in the future, it will be based on prefix or suffix indicating verification framework/infrastructure.
For instance, for UVVM it will be `tb_uvvm_` / `_uvvm_tb`, respectively for OSVVM it will be `tb_osvvm_` / `_osvvm_tb`.

If FuseSoc supports formal verification targets in the future, they will be fetched based on `fv_` prefix or `_fv` suffix.

## Installation
Latest stable version of fsva can be installed from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fsva/):
`pip install --user fsva`.

## Usage

### Example
<p align="center"><img src="/img/demo.gif?raw=true"/></p>

You can also run all testbench targets for single core:
`fsva core_name`
or run specific verification target for specific core
`fsva core_name target_name`.
When verifying single core or target, the output is printed on the console.

## Note!
If you use it with UVVM you need to fix status that is returned when UVVM test bench fails: [Integrating UVVM with Continuous Integration - problem with simulators exit status](https://github.com/UVVM/UVVM/issues/82).
