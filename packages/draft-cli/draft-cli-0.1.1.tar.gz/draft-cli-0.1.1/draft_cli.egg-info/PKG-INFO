        Draft: Write Like a Programmer
        ==============================
        Draft is a CLI-enabled *writing system* to keep your work modular, optimize your project for git for version control, and just make writing more *fun*.

        Primary Features
        ----------------
        When you're writing something short, a Google Doc or Word file works great.
        But get beyond a few thousand words and you end up in scroll-hell (i.e., the 'thumb' of the scrollbar is tiny and just navigating the doc is a chore).
        
        Draft turns that half-finished novel into a clean, plaintext file tree perfect for git.
        
        - ``parse`` any Markdown file into a file tree of Sections, Chapters, Sub-chapters, and Scenes
        - ``sequence`` your files and directories to maintain a sequential index
        - ``outline`` your project to help plan and fill in gaps
        - ``compile`` your Scenes, Sub-Chapters, Chapters, and Sections into a single document once you're ready to publish
        - Other features include ``stats`` (word count, etc.), ``trim`` (remove duplicate spaces), and ``split`` (put each sentence on its own line)
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        ``pip install draft-cli``
