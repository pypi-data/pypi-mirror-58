# LGPy
LGPy is a linear genetic programming library implemented in Python to evolve problems. In linear programming, a sequence of assembly-like instructions dictates the flow of a program. Each hardware in LGPy contains a set of instructions and a memory buffer that acts as its program.

## Installing
```pip install LGPy```

## Examples
