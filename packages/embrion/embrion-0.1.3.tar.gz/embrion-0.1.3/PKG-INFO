Description: # Embrion
        
        Embrion is a project aimed at isolating development environments of repositories. It creates a docker container
        to jump start development. Currently environment has a Jupyterlab UI, Visual Studio Code UI and SSH access. You can also
        develop using PyCharm connecting through SSH to the docker. 
        
        ## Requirements
        
        You need to have docker and docker-compose installed on your computer. 
        
        ## Limitations
        
        This project only supports conda environment files (environment.yml) with a name. Support for requirements.txt
        will be added later. For now you can list all your requirements as a pip dependency in your environment.yml file.
        See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35245401/combining-conda-environment-yml-with-pip-requirements-txt for more info.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Go to your main project directory where your environment.yml file is.

        Then start the development server using:
        
            embrion up
        
        Then open Jupyterlab UI using,
        
            embrion open-jupyter
        
        or Visual Studio Code using,
