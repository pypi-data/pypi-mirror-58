class AsyncFile(AsyncResource):
    """
    An asynchronous file object.

    This class wraps a standard file object and provides async friendly versions of the following
    blocking methods (where available on the original file object):

    * read
    * read1
    * readline
    * readlines
    * readinto
    * readinto1
    * write
    * writelines
    * truncate
    * seek
    * tell
    * flush
    * close

    All other methods are directly passed through.

    This class supports the asynchronous context manager protocol which closes the underlying file
    at the end of the context block.

    This class also supports asynchronous iteration::

        async with await aopen(...) as f:
            async for line in f:
                print(line)
