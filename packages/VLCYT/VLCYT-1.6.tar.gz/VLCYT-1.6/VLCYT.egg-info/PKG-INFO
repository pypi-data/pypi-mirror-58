        Stream your YouTube playlist in VLC behind the scenes from the command line.
        
        ## Check It Out

        ## Requirements
        
        [64-bit VLC Media Player](https://get.videolan.org/vlc/3.0.8/win64/vlc-3.0.8-win64.exe)  
        [64-bit Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.0/python-3.8.0-amd64.exe)  
        
        ### Note
        This project has only been tested on Windows 10.  
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install git+https://github.com/hillt03/VLCYT`
        
        ## Usage
        
        Be sure to include quotes around arguments.
        
        `python -m vlcyt ["<youtube_playlist_url>" -v "<VLC Install directory>"]`
        
        
        If you have VLC installed and get a FileNotFound Error, use the `-v` switch to include the path to your VLC install directory. Otherwise, don't forget to install VLC (64-bit). VLCYT will look for VLC in `C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC` by default.
        
        After running for the first time, you can then simply enter `python -m vlcyt` and the last playlist you passed in will begin playing.
        
        ### Example
        
        `python -m vlcyt "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8jrN6Kz2XbU&list=PLPVigFOpn3YjTdJ3-hIILmeP3jsjXntOU&index=1" -v "C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC"`
        
        After this initial command, do the following to load your stored settings:
        `python -m vlcyt`
        
        
        ## Commands
        
        **NOTE:** Most commands have multiple aliases separated by commas, use whichever you prefer.
