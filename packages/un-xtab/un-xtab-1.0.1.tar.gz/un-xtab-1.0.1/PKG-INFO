Description: ``un-xtab.py`` is a Python module and command-line program that rearranges data from a crosstabulated format to a normalized format. It takes data in this form:
        
        +---------+------------+------------+------------+
        | Station | 2006-05-23 | 2006-06-15 | 2006-07-19 |
        +=========+============+============+============+
        | WQ-01   | 4.5        | 3.7        | 6.8        |
        +---------+------------+------------+------------+
        | WQ-02   | 9.7        | 5.1        | 7.2        |
        +---------+------------+------------+------------+
        | WQ-03   | 10         | 6.1        | 8.8        |
        +---------+------------+------------+------------+
        
        and rearranges it into this form:
        
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | Station | Date       | Value |
        +=========+============+=======+
        | WQ-01   | 2006-05-23 | 4.5   |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | WQ-02   | 2006-05-23 | 3.7   |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | WQ-03   | 2006-05-23 | 6.8   |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | WQ-01   | 2006-06-15 | 9.7   |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | WQ-02   | 2006-05-15 | 5.1   |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | WQ-03   | 2006-06-15 | 7.2   |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | WQ-01   | 2006-07-19 | 10    |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | WQ-02   | 2006-07-19 | 6.1   |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        | WQ-03   | 2006-07-19 | 8.8   |
        +---------+------------+-------+
        
        Input and output are both text (CSV) files.
        
        You can use the un-xtab program to rearrange data that have been provided in a format designed for readability into a format that is more suitable for storage in a database, or for use with statistical, modeling, graphics, or other software.
        
        The un-xtab program can deal with crosstabbed formats that include multiple rows of column headers and groups of data values that were crosstabbed together. 
        
        A row number can be added to assist with post-processing of the output file, if necessary.
