Description: # Zero Divisor Graph math library
        
        This is a pure python library for working with zero divisor graphs of commutative semigroups. The primary purpose is to automate the task of checking if a given graph is a zero divisor graph and for what possible semigroups.
        
        # Installation
        
        ```
        pip3 install zero-divisor-graph
        ```
        
        You can also retrieve from source at https://github.com/Paulcappaert/zero-divisor-graph
        
        # use
        
        first start python3 in a terminal window and import the ZeroDivisorGraph object
        
        ```
        python3
        >>> from zdg.zdg import ZeroDivisorGraph as ZDG
        ```
        
        You can create a zero divisor graph from edges as such. the vertices can be named whatever you want.
        
        ```
        >>> example1 = ZDG((1, 2), (2, 3))
        >>> example2 = ZDG(('a', 'b'), ('b', 'c'))
        ```
        
        You can print all of the semigroups from a zero divisor graph as such
        
        ```
        >>> semigroups = example1.semigroups()
        >>> for s in semigroups:
        ...   print(s.caley_table())
        ```
