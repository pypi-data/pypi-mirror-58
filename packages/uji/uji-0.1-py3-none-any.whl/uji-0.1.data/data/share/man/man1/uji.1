\f[B]uji\f[R] <command>
.PP
\f[B]uji setup\f[R] \f[I]project\-directory\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]uji new\f[R] \f[I]source.yaml\f[R] [\f[I]directory\f[R]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]uji\f[R] is a tool to create checklists from predefined templates
and tracks the state of those checklists via git.
\f[B]uji\f[R] is not a test suite, it merely provides a repeatable
scaffolding for creating and storing checklists, log files and the
output of various commands.
.PP
\f[B]uji\f[R] parses source YAML files (see \f[B]SOURCE FILES\f[R]) and
generates a directory containing a template test log and a record of all
tests to be run.
The user can then either edit that record directly or use the
\f[B]uji\f[R] commands to add logs and tick off test results.
.PP
All data is stored in git.
\f[B]uji\f[R] expects to be run within a git directory and will commit
any changes to git immediately.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \f[B]\-h\f[R], \f[B]\-\-help\f[R]
Display a help message
.TP
.B \f[B]\-\-verbose\f[R]
Verbose output, primarily for debugging
.SH COMMANDS
.SS uji setup \f[I]project\-directory\f[R]
.PP
Set up \f[I]project\-directory\f[R] to track future checklists.
This creates the given directory, initializes it as git repository and
fills it with example templates.
.SS uji new \f[I]source.yaml\f[R] \f[I][directory]\f[R]
.PP
This command should be run from within the \f[I]project\-directory\f[R]
created by \f[B]uji setup\f[R].
.PP
Creates a new \f[I]directory\f[R] containing a markdown file that is the
checklist to be tracked.
Where the checklist contains files to record, empty template files are
generated for those.
The new test directory and any template files are committed to git.
.PP
The checklist is generated based on the \f[I]source.yaml\f[R] file.
Where \f[I]directory\f[R] is omitted, \f[B]uji new\f[R] creates a unique
directory name based on the source file and a timestamp.
.SS uji view \f[I]directory\f[R]
.PP
This command should be run from within the \f[I]project\-directory\f[R]
created by \f[B]uji setup\f[R] with a \f[I]directory\f[R] created by
\f[B]uji new\f[R].
.PP
The command \f[B]uji view\f[R] opens an interactive viewer for the
\f[B]uji\f[R] markdown file in the given directory.
Use this viewer to quickly tick off checkboxes and upload files.
