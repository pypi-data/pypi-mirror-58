pycatia
=======

pycatia was primarily created to access the CATIA API Measurable
object and it's methods without the need of visual basic / CATScripts.
There is further functionaliy available which can be seen by looking at
the examples provided and reading the API at pycatia.readthedocs.io_.


Some of the methods can be accessed simply using the pywin32 module but further 
access to methods such as GetCOG do not seem to be accessible using pure python.
There are several questions on stack overflow and the pywin32 mailing list regarding
this. But, they fail to provide any working examples with the VB Measurable object 
in python. 

pycatia accesses these methods by running VBA scripts using the 
`Dispatch('CATIA.Application').SystemService.Evaluate()` function where required
and passing a small public function to it. Otherwise, pycatia uses the VB method
directly but exposes it within the same python class.

This has currently only been tested in CATIA V5 R21.

Requirements
------------

* python >= 3.6 
* CATIA V5
* see requirements.txt

Installation
------------

with pip
~~~~~~~~

.. code-block:: python

    pip install pycatia


For more detailed instructions please refer to the installation instructions
available at pycatia.readthedocs.io_.


Usage
-----

This example shows how to get the first point in the geometrical set 'Points'.

.. code-block:: python

    # initial set-up to get access to the CATIA COM objects.
    import pycatia
    catia = pycatia.CATIAApplication()
    document = pycatia.Document(catia.catia)
    part = pycatia.Part(document.document)
    spa_workbench = pycatia.create_spa_workbench(document.document)

    # find the geometrical set by name called 'Points'
    hybrid_body = part.get_hybrid_body_by_name('Points')

    # get the first point in the geometrical set.
    point1 = hybrid_body.HybridShapes.Item(1)

    # create the reference and measurable objects
    point1_reference = pycatia.create_reference(part.part, point1)
    point1_measurable = pycatia.create_measurable(spa_workbench, point1_reference)

    # create the catia measurable object
    measurable = pycatia.CATIAMeasurable(point1_measurable)

    # run the get_point() method from CATIAMeasurable.
    point_coordinate = measurable.get_point()
    # point_coordinate is a tuple representing it's x, y, z values.
    print(point_coordinate)

    # outputs (0.0, 8.0, -4.0)
    # print x
    print(point_coordinate[0]
    # output 0,0

    document.close()
