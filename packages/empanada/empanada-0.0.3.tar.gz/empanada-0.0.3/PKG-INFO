        EMPANADA Documentation
        ======================
        
        EMPANADA is a tool for evidence-based assignment of genes to pathways in metagenomic data,
        developed and maintained by the Borenstein group at the University of Washington.
        
        ============
        Availability
        ============
        
        EMPANADA is available as a Python module from GitHub or PyPI (see installation instructions below)
        
        =======
        License
        =======
        
        EMPANADA is distributed under a non-commercial license (see LICENSE).
        
        =========================
        Installation Instructions
        =========================
        
        Prerequisites for installing:
        
        In order for EMPANADA to run successfully, the following Python modules should be pre-installed on your system:
        
        - Numpy >= 1.16.0 (http://www.numpy.org/)
        - Pandas >= 0.14 (http://pandas.pydata.org/)
        
        If you have *pip* installed, you can install these packages by running the following command:
        
        ``pip install -U numpy pandas``
        
        **Installing EMPANADA:**
        
        To install EMPANADA, download the package from https://github.com/borenstein-lab/empanada/archive/0.0.3.tar.gz
        
        After downloading EMPANADA, you’ll need to unzip the file. If you’ve downloaded the release version, do this with the following command:
        
        ``tar -xzf empanada-0.0.3.tar.gz``
        
        You’ll then change into the new EMPANADA directory as follows:
        
        ``cd empanada-0.0.3``
        
        and install using the following command:
        
        ``python setup.py install``
        
        ALTERNATIVELY, you can install EMPANADA directly from PyPI by running:
        
        ``pip install -U empanada``
        
        ============================
        Testing the software package
        ============================
        
        After downloading and installing the software, we recommend testing it by running the following command:
        
        ``test_empanada.py``
        
        This will invoke a series of tests. A correct output should end with:
        
        ``Ran 1 tests in X.XXXXs``
        
        ``OK``
        
        =================================
        EMPANADA API via the command line
        =================================
        The EMPANADA module handles all calculations internally.
        EMPANADA offers an interface to the EMPANADA functionality via the command line and the run_empanada script.

        ========
        Examples
        ========
        
        In the *empanada/examples* directory, the file *simulated_ko_relative_abundance.tab* contains simulated KO abundance measurements of 20 samples.
        Using this file as input for EMPANADA results in the following files:
        
        - pathway_abundance_empanada.tab
        
        The command used are the following (via command line):
        
        ``run_empanada.py -ko examples/simulated_ko_relative_abundance.tab -ko2path data/KOvsPATHWAY_BACTERIAL_KEGG_2013_07_15.tab -o examples/pathway_abundance_empanada.tab -threshold 0 -map by_avg_abundance -fraction -leave_one_ko_out_pathway_support -use_only_non_overlapping_genes``
