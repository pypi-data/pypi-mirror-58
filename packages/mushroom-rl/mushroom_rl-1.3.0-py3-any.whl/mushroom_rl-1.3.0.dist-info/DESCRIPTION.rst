Mushroom is a Python Reinforcement Learning (RL) librarywhose modularity allows to easily use well-known Pythonlibraries for tensor computation (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow)and RL benchmarks (e.g. OpenAI Gym, PyBullet, DeepmindControl Suite). It allows to perform RL experiments in asimple way providing classical RL algorithms(e.g. Q-Learning, SARSA, FQI), and deep RL algorithms(e.g. DQN, DDPG, SAC, TD3, TRPO, PPO).
