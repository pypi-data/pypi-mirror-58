# tox-external-wheels

Use externally created wheels with Tox

Features
--------

* The ability to define external wheel files to tests (example tox file):

```
[tox]
envlist = py-{a,b,c}
[testenv]
external_wheel =
    a: {toxinidir}/dist/*py27*.whl
    a: {toxinidir}/dist/*py37*.whl
commands =
    a,b: pytest test
    c: pip list
```

**Note**: In this case `py-c` falls back to installing from source.
