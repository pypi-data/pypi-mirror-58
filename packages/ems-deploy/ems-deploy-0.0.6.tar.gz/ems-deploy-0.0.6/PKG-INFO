Description: # EMS Deploy script
        
        This project provides a general-purpose deploy script for the EMS projects. It runs the suitable docker-compose command based on the available docker-compose files located in the directory.
        
        ## Install
        
        `pip install ems-eploy`
        
        ## Directory structure and required files
        Deploy concatenates a `docker-compose` command. The following files are recognized
        
         1. `docker-compose.yml` Required: Base file
         2. `docker-compose.deploy.yml` Required: This file is added as an additional docker-compose file
         3. `docker-compose.debug.yml` Optional: This files is used instead of `docker-compose.deploy.yml` when using the `debug` flag
        
        ## How to use
        
        The following flags are always added to the `docker-compose` command:
        
         - `--force-recreate`
         - `--renew-anon-volumes`
         - `--build`
        
        ### Deploy
        To deploy the app, simply run 
        
        `deploy`
        
        Note that it will automatically add the `-d` flag which detaches from the process afterwards.
        
        ### Debug
        To run in debug mode, run
        
        `deploy debug`
        
        Note that it will NOT automatically detach - this can however be supplied. See the next section for additional flags
        
        ### Additional flags
        
         - `-d` Detaches the process (this is automatically done in deploy-mode, but not in debug-mode)
         - `-v` Writes the resulting command to the terminal.
