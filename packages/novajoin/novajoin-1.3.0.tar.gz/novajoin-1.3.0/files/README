This directory contains configuration files placed in /etc/
(see setup.cfg for details)

IMPORTANT: cloud-config-novajoin.json is manually generated from
cloud-config-novajoin.yaml, by using tools/cloud-config-unpack.py and
tools/cloud-config-pack.py scripts.

Before editing cloud-config-novajoin.yaml, run tools/cloud-config-unpack.py.
After editing cloud-config-novajoin.yaml, run tools/cloud-config-pack.py.
This will place your edits in cloud-config-novajoin.json, which is the only
file that is installed in /etc/.

cloud-config-novajoin.json cannot be automatically generated, because we use a
setup.py provided by the global requirements repo, which we cannot modify.
