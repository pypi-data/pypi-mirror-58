        Global overview
        ---------------
        
        hg_delivery is a web application who aims to simplify the delivery of small projects and helping people to quickly
        revert to a previous stable release if something's wrong. This project targets people bothered by command line, looking
        for a nice and simple web interface, able to manage multiple remote repositories. 
        
        inspired from :
        
          - `like banana project <https://github.com/sniku/Likebanana>`_
        
        
        features list :
        
          - remote repository access *ssh only*
        
          - add/delete/edit project items
        
          - clip project on dashboard
        
          - display remote project summarize (last commit, current revision ...)
        
          - display the state of repository
        
          - update to a specific revision for remote repository
        
          - one/one repository compare
        
          - pushing or pulling on/from a remote repository
        
          - add additional task when updating a repository (*usefull for flushing the cache* or *for gracefull apache*)
        
          - responsive design (thanks to bootstrap)
        
          - a scheduler is available to close ssh pool connection if none are used, it leaves clean connections, *thx to pyramid-scheduler*
        
          - a diff viewer or merge style *thx to mergely*
