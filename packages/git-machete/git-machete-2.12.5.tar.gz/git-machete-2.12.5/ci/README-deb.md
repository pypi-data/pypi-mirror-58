git machete is a versatile tool for organizing your repo with features like:
  - neat, customizable git machete status that shows what branches are in sync
    with their parent branch/remote tracking branch and which of them need to
    be rebased/pulled/pushed,
  - semi-automatic traversal of the branches that helps you effortlessly rebase
    and push/pull the branches you care for (git machete traverse),
  - automatic discovery of branch relations (git machete discover).
