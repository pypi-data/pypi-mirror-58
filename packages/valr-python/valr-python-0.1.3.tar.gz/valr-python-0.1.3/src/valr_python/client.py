        The customerOrderId is an optional field which can be specified by clients to track
        this order using their own internal order management systems.

        - When you retrieve your open orders or history of orders, this field will also be returned along with the
        VALR's orderId for each order for which this field was specified during creation.
        - When you cancel an order, you can either specify orderId or customerOrderId, not both.
        - customerOrderId is alphanumeric with no special chars, limit of 50 characters.
        - The customerOrderId has to be unique accross all open orders for a given account.
        If you do reuse an id value that is currently an active open order, your order will not be placed
        (you can check the status of an order using the order status API call).

        - If you are a Taker and you are Buying BTC with ZAR, your fee will be charged in BTC
        - If you are a Taker and you are Selling BTC for ZAR, your fee will be charged in ZAR

        In short, fees will be in the currency that the taker is receiving and the maker is paying in the trade.

        side (required)	- BUY or SELL
        baseAmount / quoteAmount (required)	- Quote amount for BUY (in ZAR). Base amount for SELL (in BTC)
        pair (required)	- BTCZAR
        customerOrderId (optional) - Numeric value. See below for explanation.

        The customerOrderId is an optional field which can be specified by clients to track this order
        using their own internal order management systems.

        - When you retrieve your open orders or history of orders, this field will also be returned along
        with the VALR's orderId for each order for which this field was specified during creation.
        - When you cancel an order, you can either specify orderId or customerOrderId, not both.
        - customerOrderId is alphanumeric with no special chars, limit of 50 characters.
        - The customerOrderId has to be unique accross all open orders for a given account.
        If you do reuse an id value that is currently an active open order, your order will not be placed
        (you can check the status of an order using the order status API call).

        Fee currency

        When you place a market order, you will be charged the "Taker fee" on the trade.

        - As a Taker, if you are Buying BTC with ZAR, your fee will be charged in BTC
        - As a Taker, if you are Selling BTC for ZAR, your fee will be charged in ZAR

        PLEASE NOTE: When you receive a response with an id, it does not always mean that the order has been placed.
        When the response is 202 Accepted, you can use the Order Status REST API or use WebSocket API to receive
        the status of this order. The reasons why an order could fail are as follows:

        - Insufficient balance in your account.
        - If you're using a non-unique customerOrderId.
        - If you set postOnly flag to true, but your order would have matched immediately.
        - Self trading: If your order matches against your own order (on the other side).
        - Insufficient liquidity: If you're placing an order and there isn't liquidity to fulfill the order.
