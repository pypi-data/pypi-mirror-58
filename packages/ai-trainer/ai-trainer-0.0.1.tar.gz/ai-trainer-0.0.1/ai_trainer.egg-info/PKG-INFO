Description: # The Mission
        
        Need to write this out, but trust me, its thought through...
        
        # Installation for User
        
        Open anaconda powershell, navigate into the trainer repo and execute:
        
        ```bash
        pip install git+https://github.com/Telcrome/ai-trainer@master
        ```
        
        For dependencies please see the file ```environment.yml```.
        
        # Getting started
        
        After activating the environment containing the trainer and its dependencies,
        feel free to inspect some of the tutorials in ```./tutorials/```.
        
        ## Optional dependencies
        
        Annotator helps with building a data generator and it relies on imgaug for it
        ```bash
        conda config --add channels conda-forge
        conda install imgaug
        ```
        
        ## Development Setup
        
        Both vsc and pycharm are used for development with
        their configurations provided in ```.vscode``` and ```.idea```
        
        ### Installing environments
        
        For development we recommend to install the environment in a local folder.
        This allows for easier experimentation and the IDE expects it this way.
        
        ```bash
        conda env create --prefix ./envs -f environment.yml
        conda activate .\envs\.
        ```
        
        # Using Docker
        
        Docker and the provided DOCKERFILE support is currently experimental as it proved to slow down the annotation GUI too much.
        When the transition to a web GUI is completed docker will be supported again.
