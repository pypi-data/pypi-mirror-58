ullvm_c
=======

This is a project to wrap LLVM C API using a Pycopy's "ffi" module, thus
producing pure-Python bindings to a sufficiently large subset of LLVM
functionality. [Pycopy](https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy) is a minimalist
implementation of the Python language. Pycopy's "ffi" was also
[ported to CPython](https://github.com/pfalcon/pycopy-lib/tree/master/cpython-ffi),
so `ullvm_c` is compatible with CPython too (or any other Python
implementation which provides `ctypes` module).
