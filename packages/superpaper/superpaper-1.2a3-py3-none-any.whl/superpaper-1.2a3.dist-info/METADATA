# Superpaper

Superpaper is an advanced multi monitor wallpaper manager 
for **Linux** and **Windows** operating systems, with partial and untested support for **Mac OS X**.

Supported Linux desktop environments / window managers are:
- BSPWM (needs feh)
- Budgie
- Cinnamon
- Gnome
- i3 (needs feh)
- KDE*
- LXDE & LXQt
- Mate
- Pantheon
- XFCE*

and additionally there is support for
- feh
- supplying a custom command to set the wallpaper

if support for your system of choice is not built-in.

*KDE and XFCE work most reliably with monitors in a single horizontal row: some configurations with 3 or more
displays in a complex/non-row setup can have issues with spanning.

### Features
- Set a single image across all displays
- Set different image on every display
- **Pixel per inch correction***: span an image flawlessly across displays of different shapes and sizes!
- **Bezel correction***
- Manual pixel offsets for fine-tuning
- Slideshow with configurable file order from local sources
- Command-line interface
- Tray applet for slideshow control
- GUI for settings configuration
- Hotkey support for easy slideshow control (Only Linux and Windows)
- Align test tool to help fine tune your settings (Accessible only from GUI)

Span single image and set multiple image modes should work on most multi monitor arrangements.

*For PPI and bezel corrections only a single _horizontal row of monitors_ is supported at this time. Monitors can be in portrait.
For PPI correction Superpaper assumes that your displays' physical center points are on a horizontal line, if they are not you can adjust the wallpaper
using the manual offset.

In the above banner photo you can see the PPI and bezel corrections in action. The left one is a 27" 4K display, and the right one is a 25" 1440p display.

## Support
If you find Superpaper useful please consider supporting its development: [Support via PayPal][paypal-superpaper].

## Installation

### A. Portable releases
For Linux and Windows there are portable stand-alone binary packages available under [releases](https://github.com/hhannine/Superpaper/releases).
These work on a download-and-run basis without additional requirements. Look for the executable "superpaper.exe", or "superpaper" on Linux.

Standalone package for Mac OS X is unfortunately unavailable at this time, but you may look at the alternative way to run Superpaper.


### B. Run the script

You may either clone the repository or download the packaged script under releases. You will need to take care of its dependencies, which are:

#### Requirements
- Python 3.5+
- Pillow (or the slower PIL should also work, or on Linux the faster Pillow-SIMD)
- screeninfo
- wxpython (tray applet & slideshow, optional)
- system_hotkey (hotkeys, optional)

If you are going to run only in CLI mode you will need to install the first three in the list. For full functionality you will of course need to install all of them.

One can install these easily via pip3:
```
pip3 install Pillow
pip3 install screeninfo
pip3 install wxpython
pip3 install system_hotkey
```
System_hotkey has dependencies: on Linux it needs "xcffib" and "xpybutil" modules, and on Windows it needs "pywin32".
Note that on Linux wxpython needs to be built and even though it is automated via pip, it has its own [dependencies](https://wxpython.org/blog/2017-08-17-builds-for-linux-with-pip/index.html), 
and the build may take some time.
However for a few CentOS, Debian, Fedora and Ubuntu flavors there are pre-built wheels so on those you can look at the [instructions](https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/) to install wxpython
without having to build it yourself.


## Usage

You can either run Superpaper to use all of its features, or alternatively you may call it from the command-line to set your multi monitor wallpaper, 
with or without pixel density / bezel corrections or manual offsets.

**Note**: You might have to set your OS to span the wallpaper so it is displayed correctly regardless of the settings you give Superpaper:
- On Windows: Personalization -> Background -> Choose a fit -> Span.


### Full functionality / GUI mode

To provide your desired wallpaper settings, you access the 'Profile Configuration' Tray Menu item, or also during first run. General application settings are under 'Settings' in the Tray.

#### Profile configuration

Example profile configurations are provided and accessible in the Profile Configuration. (or in the Superpaper/profiles folder.)

Following settings are supported and they are expected in this form:
```
name=example
spanmode=single
slideshow=true
delay=600
sortmode=shuffle
offsets=0,0;0,0
bezels=9.5;7
diagonal_inches=27;25
hotkey=control+super+shift+x
display1paths=C:\Path\To\Image\Folder1;C:\Path\To\Image\Folder2;C:\Path\To\Image\Folder3
```
Accepted values and their explanations are:
- spanmode:
	- single &mdash; Span a single image across all of your monitors. Use with or without PPI correction.
	- multi &mdash; Multi image mode: set different image on every display.
- slideshow:
	- true
	- false
- delay:
	- integer, slideshow delay in seconds
- sortmode:
	- shuffle
	- alphabetical
- offsets
	- horizontal,vertical pixel offsets with offsets of different monitors separated by ";"
- bezels
	- List of adjacent monitor bezel pairs' thicknesses in millimeters, i.e. "bezel+gap+bezel", floats are accepted, values separated by ";". 
	- Measure adjacent bezels and add them together with a possible gap to get a combined thickness. One value for 2 monitors, two values for 3 and so on.
- diagonal_inches
	- List of monitor diagonals in inches. Used for computing display pixel densities (PPI).
- hotkey
	- Up to three modifiers are supported for a hotkey: "control", "shift", "super" (the win-key) and "alt". 
	- Separate keys with a "+" as shown above.
- display1paths
	- List of local image source paths, separate paths with a ";".
	- display1paths is used by the left-most display.
- display2paths
	- Same as display1paths, but for the 2nd monitor from the left.
	- For any additional displays paths are given via display3paths, display4paths, etc.


#### General settings

General settings are saved in Superpaper/general_settings and formatted in the following way:
```
logging=false
use hotkeys=true
next wallpaper hotkey=control+super+w
pause wallpaper hotkey=control+super+shift+p
set_command=gsettings set ...
```
Up to three modifiers are supported for a hotkey: "control", "shift", "super" (the win-key) and "alt".

The option 'set_command' accepts a user defined one liner to set the wallpaper if your system is not supported out of the box. 
As a special case, one can tell Superpaper to use feh with a tested and built-in command by setting:
```
set_command=feh
```
In the custom command, replace '/path/to/img.jpg' by '{image}', i.e. for example with the Gnome command:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file://{image}
```

Lastly, if the included white tray icon doesn't go nicely with your rice, included are a couple of alternative colorations and you may even replace the default icon with anything you wish.
Just overwrite the "default.png" icon file.


### CLI usage

Superpaper supports the following arguments, display specific values are given starting from the first display on the left.
- "--help"
- "--setimages", list of images to set on your monitors, if given only one it will be spanned across.
- "--inches", optional, expects display diagonals in inches to compute PPIs
- "--bezels", optional, expects display bezels in millimeters
- "--offsets", optional, if image alignment with ppi&bezels isn't quite right you can add additional offset in pixels
- "--command", optional, user can pass a custom command to set the wallpaper.

An example using all corrections to set a single spanned image:
```
superpaper.py --setimages /path/to/img.png --inches 27 25 --bezels 9.5 7.0 --offsets 0 0 40 -100
```
Offsets are given as a pair-wise list of "horizontal_offset vertical_offset" starting from the first monitor on the left, 
i.e. in the above example the display on the left is given no additional offset (0 0) and the display on 
the right is given a horizontal offset to the right by 40px and a vertical offset of 100px up (40 -100).

In the custom command, replace '/path/to/img.jpg' by '{image}', i.e. for example with the Gnome command:
```
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri file://{image}
```

The resulting image is saved into Superpaper/temp/ and then set as the wallpaper.


## Troubleshooting

If you run into issues and Superpaper closes unexpectedly, you can either:
- Enable logging in the 'general_settings' by setting 'logging=true'
- Run Superpaper from the command-line with the switch '--debug' to get debugging prints.
```
python superpaper.pyw --debug
```

On KDE or XFCE if you're having issues on a larger multi monitor setup it might be worthwhile to try the 'feh' mode.


Stumbling stones to keep in mind if you have issues:
- Check your image paths that there are no typos.
- Check that there are no typos in your profile configs and that the profile name in the config matches the filename.

## Known issues

### General shortcomings
- PPI & Bezel corr. only work on a single horizontal row of displays at this time, i.e. monitors side by side.
- The module used for display data gathering seems to have issues with some setups, for example with Windows 10 DPI scaling.

### Linux
- (Found in virtual machine testing) In KDE and XFCE environments image spanning can have issues if monitors are not in a horizontal row. Found with 3 virtual displays in an "L" shape.

### Windows
- A rare issue where setting the wallpaper fails and leads to a black wallpaper. Might be related to source image properties.
- Windows10 DPI scaling options can interfere with resolution detection and cause issues with background handling.

### Mac OS X
- It is not known whether this works at all. If you try it, tell me how it goes!
- The library implementing global hotkeys does not support Mac OS X at this time unfortunately.
