        Overview
        --------
        ``coverage_python_version`` is a `coverage.py`_ plugin that provides a very
        basic means for you to exclude code from your coverage measurements based on
        the version of Python that it is executed on.

        Usage
        -----
        1. Add ``coverage_python_version`` to ``plugins`` option in the ``run`` section
           of your ``coverage.py`` configuration.
        
        2. Use the comment ``# pragma: PY2`` to notate blocks of code that should be
           measured under Python 2, and ``# pragma: PY3`` to notate blocks for Python
