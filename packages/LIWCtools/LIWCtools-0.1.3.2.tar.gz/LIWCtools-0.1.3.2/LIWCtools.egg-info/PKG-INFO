Description: LIWCtools
        
        LIWCtools is a Python library that was written to support the translation of the LIWC 2007 dictionary from English into Dutch. By now it also supports other LIWC-related functionality. 
        LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, http://www.liwc.net) is a text analysis tool that counts words in certain categories. It was developed by psychologist James Pennebaker and his colleagues at the University of Texas. It comes with a dictionary, i.e. a collection of words assigned to one or more categories. These categories are either grammatical (e.g. pronouns), psychological concepts (emotions, cognitions) or life concerns (religion, home). LIWC has been used in psychological research, as well as in domains such as marketing, literature, forensic studies, etc. 
        
        LIWCtools is a not a finished product. Documentation is elementary. Its author is not an accomplished Python programmer and many routines are not very elegant. Still, I hope that this may be useful to some. If you need more info, let me know.
