STEPutils
=========

THIS PROJECT IS IN PLANNING STATE!
----------------------------------

Abstract
--------

STEPutils is a Python package to manage STEP model data.

The intention of this package is to build a simple document object model (DOM) for STEP model data like 
`xml.etree.ElementTree` for XML data. STEPutils could be used as import/export layer for CAD like application. 
The DOM has methods to traverse, create and delete object nodes but no further CAD-like functionality like translating, 
scaling or rotating objects, if you need that - you are looking for a CAD application like 
[FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/).   

For more information about the STEP (ISO 10303) standard read this 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=ISO_10303) article.
