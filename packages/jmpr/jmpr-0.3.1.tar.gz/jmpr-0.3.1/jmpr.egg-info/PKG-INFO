        ## What this is?
        Tooling to permit AWS account navigation
        
        ## How does it work?
        ![Magic](https://media.giphy.com/media/12NUbkX6p4xOO4/giphy.gif)
        
        But seriously, it does some cool stuff in really cool ways...
        
        ## How do I use it?
        
        To get started using jmpr install via pip: `pip install jmpr`.
        
         (You may need to `pip install boto3 pyyaml` to preinstall the dependencies) 
         
         To run jmpr use `jmpr -y yourfile.yml`
        
         Use the following gitlab-ci.yml configuration to run in a GitLab CI/CD Pipeline:
        
         ```yaml
        Deploy Test:
          stage: deploy
          before_script:
            - pip install . --quiet
          script:
            - jmpr -y test.yaml
         ```

        ### AWS Account Configuration
        TODO: EXPLAIN HOW TO CONFIGURE AWS ACCOUNTS TO BE USED. BOTH ORG ACCOUNTS AND NON ORG ACCOUNTS
        
        ### Your jmpr Manifest File
        jmpr accepts yaml files as input. These files define your entire authentication infrastructure. Including Accounts, Roles, Users, and Policies. 
        
        **Example Users**
        ```yaml
        users:
          - name: testuser
            additional_path: "something"
            cloud: AWS
            target_roles:
              - account: 540253368830
                role_name: ROLE-ADMIN
                region: us-west-2
              - account: 879397242692
                role_name: ROLE-DEV
              - account: 611424868009
                role_name: ROLE-NEW-ROLE
              - account: 333422963795
                role_name: ROLE-BILLING
              - account: 355841365103
                role_name: ROLE-BILLING
        
        ```
        
        
        **Example Roles**
        ```yaml
        roles:
          - name: ROLE-ADMIN
            import:
              - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess
          - name: ROLE-RO
            import:
              - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
              - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/Billing
          - name: ROLE-BILLING
            import:
              - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/Billing
          - name: ROLE-FOO
            import:
              - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ReadOnlyAccess
              - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/job-function/Billing
        ```
        
        **Example Accounts**
        ```yaml
        accounts:
          test_acct_1:
            account_number: 616552976502
        
          test_acct_2:
            name: My Account
            account_number: 426276006285
            color: ffbd05
            default_region: us-east-1
        
          test_acct_3:
            name: Your Account
            account_number: 343074669674
            color: 225f91
            default_region: us-east-2
            purge: false
            allowed_roles:
              - admin
              - ro
              - billing
        
          '420355987158':
            name: No One's Account
        ```
        For more examples please see [test.yml](test.yaml).
        
        ## Developer Notes: 
        To work on this project the following two commands will be your best friends
        
        `pip install . --no-deps` - Quickly install the local repo via pip without worring about dependencies
        
        `jmpr -y test.yaml` - Runs jmpr on the test yaml file that is designed to exersize the yaml parser
        
        The core library file is [cloudassets.py](./jmpr/cloudassets.py).
        
        The jmpr cli configuration is [cli.py](./jmpr/cli.py)
        
        ### Note on paths:
        AWS IAM fetch and create are carried out only using the name of an entity (user, group, role) by a client associated with an account.  Path does not play into AWS IAM entity retrieval or creation.
        
        Paths are embedded in resulting entity ARN's, and ARNs are used to relate entities to each other, for instance in an 'assume role policy'.  In addition, paths can be used in policies to include or exclude.
        
        So:
        * Entities (users, roles, etc.) with the same name and different paths will collide
        * Entities specified with an ARN that does not include the correct path will not be properly referenced.
        
        Maintaining and managing YAML or JSON ARNs including path is likely to introduce frequent errors and failures.  
        
        In consequence, the jmpr approach constructs entities in the way that they are fetched, by account and name, retaining any path information as decoration. 
        
        When ARNs are needed for a call, the ARN is constructed dynamically in code from the attributes of the entity, which can include the path decoration.  This ensures consistent ARNs.
        
        Initially in early release entity paths are guaranteed consistent and all equal to the asset_path, but in later releases entity-specific paths may be introduced so long as they are not embedded in ARNs.
