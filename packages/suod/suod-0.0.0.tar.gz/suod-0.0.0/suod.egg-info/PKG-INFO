        **SUOD** (Toward **S**\calable **U**\nsupervised **O**\utlier **D**\etection) is an **acceleration framework for large scale unsupervised outlier detector training and prediction**.
        Notably, anomaly detection is often formulated as an unsupervised problem since the ground truth is expensive to acquire in practice.
        As a result, analysts often build many diversified models and further combine them (sometimes with rule-based models)---this has become a standard process in many industries to 
        offset the challenges of the data imbalance and unsupervised nature. However, **building a large number of unsupervised models are very costly or even infeasible on high-dimensional, large datasets**.
        
        SUOD is therefore proposed to alleviate, if not fully fix, this problem.
        The focus of SUOD is **to accelerate the training and prediction when a large number of anomaly detectors are presented**.

        Reproduction Instructions
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        All three modules can be **executed separately** and the demo codes are in /AAAI_Workshop/{M1_RP, M2_BPS, and M3_PSA}.
        For instance, you could navigate to /M1_RP/demo_random_projection.py. Demo codes all start with "demo_*.py".
        
        **A full example may be found in demo_full.py under the root directory.**
        
        **Production level code will be released soon---it will support PyPI installation with full documentation and example!**
        
        ------------
        
        
        Installation
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        It is recommended to use **pip** for installation. Please make sure
        **the latest version** is installed, as suod is updated frequently:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install suod            # normal install
           pip install --upgrade suod  # or update if needed
           pip install --pre suod      # or include pre-release version for new features
        
        Alternatively, you could clone and run setup.py file:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           git clone https://github.com/yzhao062/suod.git
           cd suod
           pip install .
        
        
        **Required Dependencies**\ :
        
        
        * Python 3.5, 3.6, or 3.7
        * joblib
        * matplotlib (**optional for running examples**)
        * numpy>=1.13
        * numba>=0.35
        * pyod
        * scipy>=0.19.1
        * scikit_learn>=0.19.1
        
        
        **Note on Python 2**\ :
        The maintenance of Python 2.7 will be stopped by January 1, 2020 (see `official announcement <https://github.com/python/devguide/pull/344>`_).
        To be consistent with the Python change and suod's dependent libraries, e.g., scikit-learn,
        **suod only supports Python 3.5+** and we encourage you to use
        Python 3.5 or newer for the latest functions and bug fixes. More information can
        be found at `Moving to require Python 3 <https://python3statement.org/>`_.
