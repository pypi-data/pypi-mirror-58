Description: 
        This package includes financial math calculations for actuarial calculations such as annuity calculations, amortization schedule, sinking fund calculations and constructing tables with those formulas.
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        - pip install actuarialCalculations
        
        
        Annuity Calculations
        ====================
        
        Calcuating present value:
        Assuming our user would like to know the downpayment amount with provided kwargs below;
        
        Logic:
        terms, period and interest amount rate. Price - (presentValue* _N _ Repay Amount ) = Down payment
        
        Calculating the future value:
        Assuming our user pays at the end of the given period, so our program should accumulate the value with gthe iven interest rate;
        
        Logic:
        Accumulated Down payment(1+i)**N = Accumulated Price(1+i)**N - (AccumulatedValue*_N _ Repay Amount)
        
        Calculating The Down Payment with Given Time Value:
        Assuming our user wants to calculate the downpayment with the given period of time
        
        Logic:
        Accumulated Down payment = Accumulated Price ** T -(presentValue * Repay Amount ) ** T- (AccumulatedValue * Repay Amount)**-(N+T) / (1+i)**T
        
        USAGE
        =====
        
        .. code:: python
        
            '''
            Present Value method takes 5 parameters as intergers and returns downpayment amount
            '''
            presentValue = PresentValue(
                InterestRate, effectiveInterestTerms, fixedPeriod, repayAmount, price)
        
            '''
            Accumulated Value method takes 5 parameters as intergers and returns downpayment amount (future value)
            '''
            accumulatedValue = AccumulatedValue(
                InterestRate, effectiveInterestTerms, fixedPeriod, repayAmount, price)
        
            '''
            Calculate Given Time method takes 5 parameters as intergers and returns downpayment amount at any given time.
            '''
            calculateGivenTime = CalculateGivenTime(
                InterestRate, effectiveInterestTerms, fixedPeriod, repayAmount, price)
        
        
        
        Amortization Schedule Calculation
        ==================================
        method takes 4 parameters
        
        Interest rate
        Years
        Frequency of the interest that hits in that period of time
        Loan Amount
        
        
        
        
        USAGE
        =====
        .. code:: python
        
            '''Create an instance of CalctulateAmortization class and pass the parameters as intergers '''
            calculate = CalctulateAmortization(interestRate, years, frequency, loanAmount)
            '''To run the calculations we need to call execute funtion '''
            calculate.execute()
        
        
        
        Sinking Fund Calculation
        ==================================
        method takes 4 parameters
        
        Interest rate
        Years
        Frequency of the interest that hits in that period of time
        Amount
        
        
        USAGE
        =====
        .. code:: python
        
            ''' Create an instance of CalculateSinkingFund class and pass the parameters as integers'''
            calculate = CalculateSinkingFund(interestRate, years, frequency, amount)
            '''To run the calculations we need to call execute funtion '''
            calculate.execute()
