v<2.0.0> 2018-08-10

Starting from this release, mapclassify supports python 3+ only (currently 3.5
and 3.6).

This release also features a first stable version of mapclassify in
the process of pysal refactoring. There is a big change in the api in that we no
 longer provide an api module (`from mapclassify.api import Quantiles`). Instead,
 users will directly `from mapclassify import Quantiles`.
