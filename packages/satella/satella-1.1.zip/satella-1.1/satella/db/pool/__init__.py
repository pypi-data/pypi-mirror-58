        """

        This initializes a database definition. Because different databases work
        differently, you may want to read this in it's entirety in order to better
        understand what to type.

        @param cccall: A callable that can produce Connection objects
        @param cbexcepts: Array of exception types that signify that connection was broken
        @type cbexcepts: tuple or list of exceptions, or else a single exception type.
        @param cccall_args: Array of arguments to pass to cccall as *args
        @param cccall_kwargs: Dictionary of arguments to pass to cccall as **kwargs
        @param xwcb: If the database layer throws an exception, and it's type belongs to
            cbexcepts, this callable/1 will be called with exception instance as parameter.
            It is to return True if this indeed was the case that connection was broken. This
            can be used to discern if disconnection signalling is more complex that an exception
            of given type. If xwcb return False, the exception will be reraised.
        @param acs: callable that accepts connection as a parameter and performs extra operations on it.
            What it returns doesn't matter.

            For example if you needed an autocommit psycopg2 connection you could do:

                def acs(c): c.autocommit = True
                dd = DatabaseDefinition(psycopg2.connect, ..., ..., ..., ..., acs)

        @type acs: callable/1
        @param occ: callable that accepts a freshly created cursor via .cursor() to execute some 
            operations on it. What it returns doesn't matter.
        @type occ: callable/1
        @param oct: callable that accepts a freshly created cursor via .transaction() to execute some
            operations on it. What it returns doesn't matter.

            For example, you may want to begin a transaction, because MySQL does not implicitly start them
            unless set with autocommit:

            def oct(c): c.execute('START TRANSACTION')
            dd = DatabaseDefinition(psycopg2.connect, ..., ..., ..., ..., ..., ...., oct)

            Some better-behaved databases do, and in that case you may wish to leave this parameter
            at it's default.

        @type oct: callable/1
        @param integ_err_cls: tuple of A, B. If .execute() throws an 
            exception of this class A, it will be rethrown as B (raise B)
        @type integ_err_cls: tuple of (class, class)
