Ampoule 0.3.1 (2017-12-10)
==========================

  - Restored to original name after maintenance handover.
  - Updated home page to new source code location.
  - Minor python 2 compatibility issue in the tests (introduced in 0.3.0) fixed.

Ampoul3 0.3.0 (2017-12-10)
==========================

Changes
-------

  - Python 3 support.
  - Pyflakes fixes.
  - No more trailing whitespace :).
  - Migrated to Git.
  - (Hopefully temporary) package name change while I wait for Valentino to
    give me access to PyPI...

Ampoule 0.2.0 (2010-02-02)
==========================

Changes
--------
  - Fixed bug #317287: Twisted was required by setup.py due to import
      of application code to get the version number. The setup.py now
      tries to do the same thing but if it fails it uses a separate
      hardcoded version.
  - Fixed bug #317077: Ampoule didn't work on windows xp due to childFD
      customization, now on windows ampoule uses the standard 0,1,2 fds.
  - Added pyOpenSSL as an explicit dependency since Twisted doesn't
    require it but AMP does.
  - Greatly simplify setup.py and support plain distutils too.
  - Bootstrap code now supports context managers
  - Support for execution deadline on child calls
  - Parametrize the timeout signal to send to the child
  - Pass arguments directly from the ProcessPool object for the child
    process creation.
    

Ampoule 0.1 (2008-11-15)
==========================

Changes
--------

  - Fixed bug #276841: Add timeout for subprocess calls.
     The ProcessPool constructor now supports an additional timeout
     argument that specifies a pool level timeout, in seconds, before
     which every call ever made should return. Alternatively there is
     also a per-call mechanism. Currently this second per-call system
     is not available when using the remote pool service, so be sure
     to set the timeout command line parameter at an high enough level
     to satisfy all the possible commands. If a command doesn't require
     an answer the timeout doesn't apply, of course.
     
     The error returned when a call is timedout is 'error.ProcessTerminated'.
     On *nix systems the process is terminated with signal 9, on windows
     ampoule uses SIGTERM and returns error code 255.

Ampoule 0.0.5 (2008-11-12)
==========================

Changes
--------
 - Fixed bug #259264, this fix introduces a number of changes in the
   architecture of the project:
    1. Removed childReactor argument form the process pool and added
       a starter argument.
    2. Introduced the concept of a starter object whose role is to
       start subprocesses with given parameters. This makes it easier
       to specify particular parameters (eg. new env variables) to the
       child processes without needing to override many methods in the
       pool using closures.
    3. main.py is completely changed and now provides the ProcessStarter
       object which is a default implementation of IStarter.
    4. IStarter interface currently documents only 2 methods:
            startAMPProcess
            startPythonProcess
        in the future it's possible that we will add an additional:
            startProcess
        that starts whichever process we want without requiring python,
        also this might end up with the separation of ProcessPool in at
        least 2 logical levels: the ProcessPool and a dispatcher that
        talks with the children, in this way it would be possible to
        create custom ProcessPools without changing much code or requiring
        any special requirement on the children.

 - Introduced a callRemote method on the ProcessPool that is basically
   the same as doWork. Introduced for symmetry between all the RPC libraries
   in Twisted.

 - reactor short name and ampoule child class are now passed as the 2
   last arguments rather than the first 2. So if you have written any
   custom bootstrap code be sure to change sys.argv[1] and sys.argv[2]
   into sys.argv[-2] and sys.argv[-1] respectively.


Ampoule 0.0.4 (2008-11-03)
==========================

Changes
--------
 - Ampoule parent process and child processes now talk using FDs 3 (in)
   and 4 (out) in order to avoid problems with libraries that mistakenly
   send error lines to stdout (yes, I'm looking at you gtk+)

Ampoule 0.0.3 (2008-10-01)
==========================

Features
--------
 - Added a Twisted Matrix plugin to run a process pool service that
   can be used over the network using an AMP client.
 
 - Added ability to change the reactor used to run the children

Changes
-------
 - If you wrote your own bootstrap code for the pool you should change
   the way it works because now it takes 2 arguments, sys.argv[1] is
   the reactor short name while sys.argv[2] is still the AMPChild path.
   If you don't use startAMPProcess you probably have nothing to worry
   about.
 
Fixes
-----
 - Now the process pool doesn't raise an error when you use a command
   that doesn't require an answer.

Ampoule 0.0.2 (2008-09-26)
==========================

Features
--------
 - Support process recycling after predefined number of calls.

Changes
-------
 - ProcessPool argument max_idle is now maxIdle to comply with Twisted
   style guidelines.

 - ProcessPool.startAWorker is now a synchronous call

 - removed ampoule.runner module because it was essentially useless,
   if you want to change subprocess startup behavior pass it as an
   argument by overriding the processFactory with a closure like this:
       
       from ampoule.main import startAMPProcess
       from ampoule.pool import ProcessPool
       pp = ProcessPool()
       def myProcessFactory(*args, **kwargs):
           kwargs['bootstrap'] = myBootstrapCode
           return startAMPProcess(*args, **kwargs)
       pp.processFactory = staticmethod(myProcessFactory)
