    r"""
    A (potential) rule for courts to use in resolving litigation.

    Described in terms of inputs and outputs, and also potentially
    "despite" :class:`.Factor`\s, which occur when a :class:`Rule`
    could be said to apply "even if" some "despite" factor is true.

    Users generally should not need to interact with this class
    directly, under the current design. Instead, they should interact
    with the class :class:`.Rule`.

    :param outputs:
        an outcome that a court may accept based on the presence
        of the ``inputs``

    :param inputs:
        supporting :class:`.Factor`\s in favor of the ``output``.
        The ``input`` :class:`.Factor`\s are not treated as
        potential undercutters.

    :param despite:
        :class:`.Factor`\s that do not prevent the court from
        imposing the ``output``. These could be considered
        "failed undercutters" in defeasible logic. If a :class:`.Factor`
        is relevant both as support for the output and as
        a potential undercutter, include it in both ``inputs``
        and ``despite``.

    :param name:
        An identifier that can be used to reference and
        incorporate an existing procedure in a new
        :class:`.Factor`, instead of constructing a new
        copy of the :class:`.Procedure`.

    :param absent:
        Whether the absence, rather than presence, of this
        :class:`.Procedure` is being referenced. The usefulness
        of this is unclear, but I'm not prepared to eliminate it
        before the :class:`.Argument` class has been implemented
        and tested.

    :param generic:
        Whether the this :class:`Procedure` is being referenced
        as a generic example, which could be replaced by any
