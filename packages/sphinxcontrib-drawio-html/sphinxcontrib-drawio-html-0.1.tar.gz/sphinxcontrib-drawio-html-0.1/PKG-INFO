Description: # sphinxcontrib-drawio-html
        Sphinx Extension to add the ``drawio-html`` directive to include 
        draw.io diagrams into the generated HTML documentation.
        
        **Important:** This is an alpha extension and as such may not work or
        fit your needs 100%.  See the KNOWN ISSUES SECTION. 
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. ``python3 -m pip install sphinxcontrib-drawio-html`` or use ``pipenv`` 
        2. In your sphinx config:
        ```python
        extensions = [
            "sphinxdrawio.drawio_html"
        ]
        ```
        
        ## Options
        
        At this time no options in ``conf.py`` are supported. 
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        .. drawio-html:: example.drawio
            :page: class-diagram
            :expanded:
            :hide-nav:
            :force-name:
        
            style-overrides
        
        ```
        
        ## known issues
        1. This extension is tested using read-the-docs theme only.  It uses jQuery and font-awesome
           that comes with rtd theme, and without the theme, it will not likely work. 
        2. Only HTML translators are created, which means Latex and PDF support will not likely
           work. PDF and other builders are not tried at all. 
        3. Custom styleoverrides are working intermittently.  Some with HTML/CSS expertise might
           help in troubleshooting why not. 
        
        ## Wish list 
        1. Provide defaults in the conf.py for expanded, hide-nav and force-name so that, a site
           can decide their basic way of showing the files.  Currently it has to be done at 
           each file. 
        2. Change the content area to accept some rst per page in the draw.io diagram so that it
           can interspread easily with in the diagrams.  Presentation can also be changed to show
           the diagrams and content for that section. Only option for now is the add multiple
           directives. 
            ```
            .. drawio-html:: example.drawio
                :expanded:
                :hide-nav:
                :force-name:
        
                style-overrides
        
                class-diagram:
                    lorum ipsum dorum
        
                sequence-diagram:
                    nice orderly work.
        
            ```
        3. Add some tests.  Do not even know how other sphinx extensions are tested. 
        4. Full screen display of the diagrams. 
        5. Provided notes can be added per diagram, provide a layout option to place
           notes on the right or bottom. 
        
        Do file issues if you see something, or better yet open a pull request :-)
