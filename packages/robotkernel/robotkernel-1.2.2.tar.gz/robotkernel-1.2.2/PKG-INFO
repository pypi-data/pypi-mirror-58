Description: Robotkernel
        ===========
        
        `Robot Framework`_ IPython_ kernel for `Jupyter Notebook`_ and JupyterLab_. Check a `video to see it in action`_.
        
        Requires Python 3.6 or later with setuptools 40.5.0 later and Robot Framework
        3.1 or later.
        
        Log | Report -links on existing notebooks are only active on trusted notebooks.

        Try Robotkernel at Binder
        -------------------------
        
        Jupyter Notebook: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/robots-from-jupyter/robotkernel/master?urlpath=tree/example.ipynb
        
        JupyterLab: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/robots-from-jupyter/robotkernel/master?urlpath=lab/tree/example.ipynb
        
        
        Install Robotkernel
        -------------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ pip install robotkernel
        
        For JupyterLab you should also install the companion syntax highlighting and Jupyter widgets support:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_robotmode
           $ jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
        
        For some environments it might be required to run the following command to
        manually register robotkernel as Jupyter kernel:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ python -m robotkernel.install
        
        
        Install Robotkernel from Python 3 notebook
        ------------------------------------------
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           !pip install robotkernel
        
        After refreshing the notebook, it is possible change the kernel to Robot Framework kernel or create a new notebook with Robot Framework kernel.
        
        For JupyterLab you should also install the companion syntax highlighting and Jupyter widgets support:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           !jupyter labextension install jupyterlab_robotmode
           !jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
        
        
        Export robot files
        ------------------
        
        It is possible to export test suites direclty from Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab user interface (into traditional ``.robot`` files), but also from command line:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ jupyter nbconvert --to script example.ipynb
        
        
        Execute notebooks
        -----------------
        
        Robotkernel installs script named ``nbrobot``, which the Robot Frameworks test runner ``robot`` with support for executing Jupyter notebooks created with Robotkernel:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ nbrobot example.ipynb
        
        In addition, it is also possible to execute notebooks as such, resulting into a new notebook with embedded execution logs and reports:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute example.ipynb
        
        This will stop the execution at first failing test case.
        
        When execution with errors, to also get a result notebook with execution logs saved, an extra flag ``--ExecutePreprocessor.allow_errors=True`` must be set:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           $ jupyter nbconvert --ExecutePreprocessor.allow_errors=True --to notebook --execute example.ipynb
        
        This `may change`__ in future versions of nbconvert.
        
        __ https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues/626
        
        Note that when executing a notebook, each cell with tests cases or tasks will be executed as its own suite. It might be more efficient to export notebook into a robot script and execute that with the traditional robot runner.
        
        
        Local installation and development
        ----------------------------------
        
        See also: http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
        
        Create and activate clean Python virtual environment::
        
            $ venv myenv
            $ source myenv/bin/activate
        
        Install Jupyter::
        
            $ pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
            $ pip install jupyter
        
        Clone this kernel::
        
            $ git clone https://github.com/robots-from-jupyter/robotkernel.git
            $ cd robotkernel
        
        Install the kernel into virtualenv in develop mode::
        
            $ python setup.py develop
        
        Launch the jupyter::
        
            $ jupyter notebook
        
        Reloading the kernel reloads the code.
