Correlated Dataset
------------------

The Core Scientific Dataset Model (CSDM) supports multiple dependent
variables that share the same `d`-dimensional coordinate grid, where
:math:`d>=0`.
We call the dependent variables from these datasets as `correlated datasets`.

In this section, we go over a few examples.
