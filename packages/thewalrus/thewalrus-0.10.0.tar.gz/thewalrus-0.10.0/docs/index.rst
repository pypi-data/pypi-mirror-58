The Walrus
##########

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

A library for the calculation of hafnians, Hermite polynomials and Gaussian boson sampling.

Features
========

* Fast calculation of hafnians, loop hafnians, and torontonians of general and certain structured matrices.

* An easy to use interface to use the loop hafnian for Gaussian quantum state calculations.

* Sampling algorithms for hafnian and torontonians of graphs.

* Efficient classical methods for approximating the hafnian of non-negative matrices.

* Easy to use implementations of the multidimensional Hermite polynomials, which can also be used to calculate hafnians of all reductions of a given matrix.

Getting started
===============

To get the The Walrus installed and running on your system, begin at the :ref:`download and installation guide <installation>`. Then, familiarise yourself with some :ref:`background information on the Hafnian <hafnian>` and :ref:`the computational algorithm <algorithms>`.

For getting started with using the The Walrus in your own code, have a look at the `Python tutorial <hafnian_tutorial.ipynb>`_.

Finally, detailed documentation on the code and API is provided.
