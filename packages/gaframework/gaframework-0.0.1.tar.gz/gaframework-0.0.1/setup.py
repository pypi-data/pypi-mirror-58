# After Twine is installed, we can open the Terminal (Alt+F12) and run twine register dist/pad-on-left-1.0.0.tar.gz -r testpypi and then twine upload dist/* -r testpypi. If these commands executed correctly, you should be able to find your package on testpypi.
#
# If everything looks good on testpypi, you can run the same commands without -r testpypi:
#
# twine register dist/pad-on-left-1.0.0.tar.gz
# twine upload dist/*
#
# And after those commands completed successfully, youâ€™ve uploaded your package to PyPI! Congratulations!
