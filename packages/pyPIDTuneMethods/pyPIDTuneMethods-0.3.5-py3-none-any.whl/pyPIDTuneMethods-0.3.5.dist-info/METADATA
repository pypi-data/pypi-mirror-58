#pyPIDTuneMethods

pyPIDTuneMethods is a free python-based tool for PID controller design and tuning and is based on [scipy] (<http://www.scipy.org/), [guiqwt] (http://code.google.com/p/guiqwt/) and [pyQt5] (http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk).

You can easily build the standalone 'exe' version using the command : 'python cx_frz_create_exe.py build' from the installation folder (you will need to install 'cx_freeze' package).Unfortunately the size is huge i.e. almost 500MBs.
