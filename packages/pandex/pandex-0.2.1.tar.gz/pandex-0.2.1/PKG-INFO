Description: # pandex - An Extension Framework for pandas
        
        `pandex` is a framework for creating, managing and sharing extensions
        for the `pandas` package.
        
        There is a built-in extension system in `pandas` but it is not
        straightforward to share these between projects, virtual environments,
        other users on the same server or indeed, the wider world.
        
        `pandex` allows extensions to be installed from local files, directories
        or directly from public GitHub repositories.  Once installed, they persist 
        for a user across multiple virtual environments.
        
        Any existing script can be upgraded to support extensions with a single 
        line change. Simply replace:
        
        ```
        import pandas as pd
        ```
        
        with:
        
        ```
           import pandex as pd
        ```
        
        and all dataframes created from `pd` will be able to access installed extensions.
        
        An demo extension which calculates the circumference and area of circles from a
        column of radius values can be installed:
        
        ```
            pd.ext.import_extension('github:connectedblue/pdext_collection -> circle_calculations')
        ```
        
        Whenever these calculations are required for a dataframe `df` which contains
        a column `radius`, the extension can be called:
        
        ```
           df.ext.circle_calculations()
        ```
        
        To see the currently installed extensions:
        
        ```
           pd.ext.show_extensions()
        ```
