Description: # unidic-py
        
        This is a version of [UniDic](https://unidic.ninjal.ac.jp/) packaged for use
        with pip. 
        
        This is based on UniDic 2.1.2, which is roughly 55MB zipped or 300MB unzipped.
        There are more recent versions of UniDic but they're significantly larger,
        which makes packaging difficult.
        
        This package distributes only the files necessary for using UniDic with MeCab.
        The large files are gzipped for distribution and unzipped the first time the
        library is imported. It would be better for MeCab to unzip on the fly when
        reading from disk but it doesn't support that.
        
        Example use with [fugashi](https://github.com/polm/fugashi), though [mecab-python3](https://github.com/samurait/mecab-python3) works the same way:
        
            import fugashi
            import unidic
            tagger = fugashi.Tagger('-d{}'.format(unidic.DICDIR))
            # that's it!
