        ### Installing
        
        
        ```
        pip install pyezviz
        ```
        
        ## Playing with it
        
        ```
        pyezviz -u em@il -p PASS get_devices
        ...
        pyezviz -u em@il -p PASS --debug switch_devices --enable=1
        ```
        
        ## Running the tests
        The tox configuration is already included.
        Simply launch:
        ```
        $ tox
        ```
        
        (Do not forget to 'pip install tox' if you do not have it.)
        Tests are written in the tests directory.
        tests/data folder contains samples of EzvizLife API for tests purposes.
        
        
        ## Side notes
        
        As there is no official documentation on the API, I had to reverse-engineer what is the one used in the Ezviz IOS APP.
        
        
        ## Contributing
        
        Any contribution is welcome, considering the number of features the API provides, there is room for improvement!
