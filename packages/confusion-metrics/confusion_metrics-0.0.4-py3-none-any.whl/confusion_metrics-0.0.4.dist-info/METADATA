# David's helpful metrics library

There are many different ways to evaluate a confusion matrix. 
This helpful module implements a large number of them

    * acc 
    * accuracy 
    * acp 
    * bajic_k 
    * chisquare 
    * ctg 
    * f2measure 
    * fmeasure 
    * fprate 
    * fscore 
    * gdip1 
    * gdip2 
    * gdip3 
    * ivesgibbs 
    * list_metrics 
    * logpower 
    * power 
    * precision 
    * q1 
    * q2 (True Positive rate, recall, sensitivity)
    * q3 
    * q4 
    * q5 
    * q6 
    * q7  (Matthews Correlation Coefficient)
    * req (relative Error Quotient)
    * roc 
    * specificity 
    * tanimoto (Tanimoto Index)
    * yule
    * hamming (Hamming distance as a proportion)
    * jaccard

The original impelmentation was in Perl around 2005 and I appear to have not 
noted many of the references. My apologies.

Details of the calcualtion are in the docstring. This module should be used as follows:

`from metrics import Metrics`

`Metrics.list_metrics() # lists method names`

`Metrics.list_metrics(verbose=True) # gives a dictionary with the docstring`

`Metrics.measure(method, tp=TP, fp=FP, tn=TN, fn=FN) # for True Positive, False Negative etc.`

You probably want to wrap this  with `try .. except` as it will show an error if inappropriate data is given.
The `measure` method will convert counts to proportional data.

Don't forget to `Metrics.cite(method)` which will give a list of citations, if available. If you wish to add to the citations then submit a pull request.

I'd like to expand the help text in due course for each metric.
