# David's helpful metrics library

There are many different ways to evaluate a confusion matrix. 
This helpful module implements a large number of them

The original impelmentation was in Perl around 2005 and I appear to have not 
noted many of the references. My apologies.

Details of the calcualtion are in the docstring. This module should be used as follows:

`from metrics import Metrics`

`Metrics.list_metrics() # lists method names`

`Metrics.list_metrics(verbose=True) # gives a dictionary with the docstring`

`Metrics.measure(method, tp=TP, fp=FP, tn=TN, fn=FN) # for True Positive, False Negative etc.`

You probably want to wrap this  with `try .. except` as it will show an error if inappropriate data is given.
The `measure` method will convert counts to proportional data.

Don't forget to `Metrics.cite(method)` which will give a list of citations, if available. If you wish to add to the citations then submit a pull request.

I'd like to expand the help text in due course for each metric.

Further information on many of the metrics and their behaviour can be found at  (Tharwat, Applied Computing and Informatics (2018),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aci.2018.08.003)[https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aci.2018.08.003]
