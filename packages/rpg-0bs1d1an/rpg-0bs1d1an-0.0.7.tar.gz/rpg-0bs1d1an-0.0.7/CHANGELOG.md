## [0.0.7] - 2019-12-27

### Added

- Added support for YAML input files, for those that favour YAML over CSV (or vice versa). Input CSV files are still supported.
- Added CHANGELOG.md

### Changed

- The '--axis-labels' and '--axis-arrows' arguments no longer require a value. Specifying the argument by itself suffices now.
- Fixed the donut function.

### Removed

- The '--legend' argument was broken for some time now, was no longer supported, and is now removed.
