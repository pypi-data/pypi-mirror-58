If you don't know what it does you probably don't need it ðŸ™ƒ\n\n# What does it do?\nThis utility automagically fixes issues caused by these factors combined:\n* `poetry 0.12.*`\n* `pip 19.*`\n* Use a private package repo which requires authentication\n* Have special characters in your credentials for this private repo\n    * _commonly caused by having an email as a username (the '@' is not URL legal)_\n\nIf you are stuck in this situation you'll find yourself changing the credentials between quoted and non-quoted as _some_ `poetry` commands only work with quoted creds while _others_ only work with non-quoted creds.\n\n# How do I use it?\n1. Install `poetry`\n    * Best to follow the [install procedure on the official `poetry` repo](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry#installation)\n2. Install `pooetry`\n    * You can use the package manager of your choice for this, `pip install pooetry` for example\n3. When you want to run `poetry` simply use `pooetry` instead.
