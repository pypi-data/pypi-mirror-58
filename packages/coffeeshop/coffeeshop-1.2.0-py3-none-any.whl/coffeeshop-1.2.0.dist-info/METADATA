# Coffeeshop

This package sends your deep learning model's training and validation metrics to your slack channel after every specified epoch.
It uses slackclient and keras python packages.

Made for keras framework.

### Installation

>$ **pip install coffeeshop**


### Code sample

```python
from coffeeshop.coffeeshop import Coffeeshop

secret = 'xoxp-slacktoken'

# For sending metrics to channel.
channel_name = 'name_of_channel_to_be_posted'

histories = Coffeeshop(token = secret, channel_name = channel_name, epoch_num = 5)

# For sending metrics to user.

user = 'User Name'

histories = Coffeeshop(token = secret, user_name = user, epoch_num = 5)

## Add histories in the callbacks.

model.fit(X_train, Y_train, epochs = epochs, batch_size = batch_size,callbacks = [histories])

```
