        Demo of the classifier available at http://bpraneeth.com/projects/nudenet
        
        Code used to create the demo available at https://github.com/bedapudi6788/NudeNet/issues/16#issuecomment-522936659

        # Classification Classes
        
        nude -> image contains nudity
        
        safe -> image doesn't contain nudity
        
        # Detection Classes
        BELLY -> exposed belly (both male and female)
        
        BUTTOCKS -> exposed buttocks (both male and female)
        
        F_BREAST -> exposed female breast
        
        F_GENITALIA -> exposed female genitalia
        
        M_GENITALIA -> exposed male genitalia
        
        M_BREAST -> exposed male breast
        
        # Installation
        ```bash
        pip install nudenet
        # or
        pip install git+https://github.com/bedapudi6788/NudeNet
        ```
        
        # Classifier Usage
        ```python
        from nudenet import NudeClassifier
        classifier = NudeClassifier()
        classifier.classify('path_to_nude_image')
        # {'path_to_nude_image': {'safe': 5.8822202e-08, 'unsafe': 1.0}}
        ```
        
        # Classifier now available with tfserving docker image
        ```bash
        # Get the docker image
        docker pull bedapudi6788/nudeclassifier:v1
        docker run -d -p 8500:8500 bedapudi6788/nudeclassifier:v1
        
        # Installing python client
        pip install nudeclient
        
        ```
        
        ```python
        import nudeclient
        # Single image prediction
        nudeclient.predict('path_to_nude_image')
        {'path_to_nude_image': {'safe': 5.8822202e-08, 'unsafe': 1.0}}
        
        # Batch predictions
        nudeclient.predict(['path_to_image_1', 'path_to_image2])
        {'path_to_image_1': {'safe': 5.8822202e-08, 'unsafe': 1.0}, 'path_to_image_2': {'safe': 5.8822202e-08, 'unsafe': 1.0}}
        
        ```
        
        # Detector Usage
        ```python
        from nudenet import NudeDetector
        detector = NudeDetector()
        
        # Performing detection
        detector.detect('path_to_nude_image')
        # [{'box': [352, 688, 550, 858], 'score': 0.9603578, 'label': 'BELLY'}, {'box': [507, 896, 586, 1055], 'score': 0.94103414, 'label': 'F_GENITALIA'}, {'box': [221, 467, 552, 650], 'score': 0.8011624, 'label': 'F_BREAST'}, {'box': [359, 464, 543, 626], 'score': 0.6324697, 'label': 'F_BREAST'}]
        
        # Censoring an image
        detector.censor('path_to_nude_image', out_path='censored_image_path', visualize=False)
        
        ```
        
        # Classifier data available at https://archive.org/details/NudeNet_classifier_dataset_v1
        
        # To Do:
        1. Improve Documentation for the functions. (Right now user has to see the function definition to understand all the params)
        2. Convert these models into tflite, tfjs and create another repo that used tfjs to perform in browser detection and censor.
