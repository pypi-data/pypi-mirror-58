# conjur-api-python3

Python3-based API SDK for [Conjur OSS](https://www.conjur.org/). The repo
also includes a self-contained CLI tool (`conjur-cli`) that wraps the API
in a simple executable script/binary.

---

### **Status**: Alpha

#### **Warning: Naming and APIs are still subject to breaking changes!**

---


## Installing the code

### From PyPI

```
$ pip3 install conjur-client
```

### From source

```
$ pip3 install .
```

Note: On some machines, you have to use `pip` instead of `pip3` but in most cases,
you will want to use `pip3` if it's available for your platform.

## Usage

### CLI

CLI can either be used with the included executable script:

```shell
conjur-cli --insecure -l https://myserver -a orgname -u admin -p secret \
  variable get foo/bar
```

Or through the installed module:

```shell
python -m conjur --insecure -l https://myserver -a orgname -u admin -p secret list
```

### API

Most usage is done by creating a Client instance and then invoking the API on it:

#### With login ID and password

```python3
#!/usr/bin/env python3

from conjur import Client

client = Client(url='https://conjur.myorg.com',
                account='default',
                login_id='admin',
                password='mypassword',
                ca_bundle='/path/to/my/ca/bundle')

print("Setting variable...")
client.set('conjur/my/variable', 'new value')

print("Fetching variable...")
new_value = client.get('conjur/my/variable')

print("Variable value is:", new_value.decode('utf-8'))
```

#### With login Id and API key

Write the code same as in the first example but create the client with the following arguments:

```python3
client = Client(url='https://conjur.myorg.com',
                account='default',
                login_id='admin',
                api_key='myapikey',
                ca_bundle='/path/to/my/ca/bundle')
```

#### With `.netrc` and `.conjurrc` settings

Write the code same as in the first example but create the client with the following arguments:

```python3
client = Client()
```

## Currently supported client methods:

#### `get(variable_id)`

Gets a variable value based on its ID. Variable is binary data
that should be decoded to your system's encoding (e.g.
`get(variable_id).decode('utf-8')`.

#### `get_many(variable_id[,variable_id...])`

Gets multiple variable values based on their IDs. Variables are
returned in a dictionary that maps the variable name to its value.

#### `set(variable_id, value)`

Sets a variable to a specific value based on its ID.

Note: Policy to create the variable must have been already loaded
otherwise you will get a 404 error during invocation.

#### `apply_policy_file(policy_name, policy_file)`

Applies a file-based YAML to a named policy. This method only
supports additive changes. Result is a dictionary object constructed
from the returned JSON data.

#### `replace_policy_file(policy_name, policy_file)`

Replaces a named policy with one from the provided file. This is
usually a destructive invocation. Result is a dictionary object
constructed from the returned JSON data.

#### `delete_policy_file(policy_name, policy_file)`

Modifies an existing Conjur policy. Data may be explicitly
deleted using the !delete, !revoke, and !deny statements. Unlike
"replace" mode, no data is ever implicitly deleted. Result is a
dictionary object constructed from the returned JSON data.

#### `list()`

Returns a Python list of all the available resources for the current
account.
