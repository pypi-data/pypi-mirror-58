There are two different types of models that use gatekeeping:

    1. GatekeeperAbstractModel:
        Models that have individual objects, where each one is handled separately.
        e.g., the objects in an Article model may be live, might be waiting for their
        live_as_of date to happen, might be in preparation, or might be turned off.

    2. GatekeeperSerialAbstractModel:
        Models where only ONE object is meant to be live at any time.
        e.g., a Homepage model might have several "queued up" to go live at any given time.

        For these models there is an extra field for default_live
        which is used if the logic doesn't return any particular object.
