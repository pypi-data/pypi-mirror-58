v3.0.0rc1 (UNRELEASED)
======================

Initial release which extracts the Mopidy-MPD extension from Mopidy core.

This is an alpha release because it depends on the pre-releases of Mopidy 3.0.

Changes since Mopidy 2.3:

- Improved the ``swap`` command to swap the tracks without rebuilding
  the full tracklist.
