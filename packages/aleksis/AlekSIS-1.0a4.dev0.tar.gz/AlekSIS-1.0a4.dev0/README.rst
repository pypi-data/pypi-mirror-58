What AlekSIS is
----------------

AlekSIS is a web-based school information system (SIS) which can be used to
manage and/or publish organisational subjects of educational institutions.

It was originally developed together with Städt. Leibniz-Gymnasium Remscheid
as a proprietary product. Five years after the school stole the original
code base, as a complete re-implementation as well-designed, free and open
source software, BiscuIT-ng was started. In the meantime, students from the
Katharineum in Lübeck implemented School-Apps with the same goals and tools.
In 2020, BiscuIT-ng and School-Apps were combined into AlekSIS.

AlekSIS is a platform based on Django, that provides central funstions
and data structures that can be used by apps that are developed and provided
seperately. The core can interact closely with the Debian Edu / Skolelinux
system.
