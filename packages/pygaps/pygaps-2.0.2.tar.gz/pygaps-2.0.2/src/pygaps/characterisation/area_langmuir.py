def area_langmuir(isotherm, limits=None, verbose=False):
    r"""
    Calculate the Langmuir-determined surface area of an isotherm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    isotherm : PointIsotherm
        The isotherm of which to calculate the Langmuir surface area.
    limits : [float, float], optional
        Manual limits for region selection.
    verbose : bool, optional
        Prints extra information and plots graphs of the calculation.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary of results with the following components. The basis of these
        results will be derived from the basis of the isotherm (per mass or per
        volume of adsorbent):

        - ``area`` (float) : calculated Langmuir surface area, in m2/unit of adsorbent
        - ``langmuir_const`` (float) : the constant in the Langmuir fit
        - ``n_monolayer`` (float) : the amount adsorbed at the monolayer
        - ``langmuir_slope`` (float) : slope of the Langmuir plot
        - ``langmuir_intercept`` (float) : intercept of the Langmuir plot
        - ``corr_coef`` (float) : correlation coefficient of the linear region in the Langmuir plot

    Notes
    -----
    *Description*

    The Langmuir theory [#]_, proposed at the start of the 20th century, states that
    adsorption happens on active sites on a surface in a single layer. It is
    derived based on several assumptions.

        * All sites are equivalent and have the same chance of being occupied
        * Each adsorbate molecule can occupy one adsorption site
        * There are no interactions between adsorbed molecules
        * The rates of adsorption and desorption are proportional to the number
          of sites currently free and currently occupied, respectively
        * Adsorption is complete when all sites are filled.

    The Langmuir equation is then:

    .. math::

        n = n_m\frac{KP}{1+KP}

    The equation can be rearranged as:

    .. math::

        \frac{P}{n} = \frac{1}{K n_m} + \frac{P}{n_m}

    Assuming the data can be fitted with a Langmuir model, by plotting
    :math:`\frac{P}{n}` against pressure, a line will be obtained. The slope and
    intercept of this line can then be used to calculate :math:`n_{m}`,
    the amount adsorbed at the monolayer, as well as K, the Langmuir constant.

    .. math::

        n_m = \frac{1}{s}

        K = \frac{1}{i * n_m}

    The surface area can then be calculated by using the moles adsorbed at the
    monolayer. If the specific area taken by one of the adsorbate molecules on the surface
    is known, it is inserted in the following equation together with Avogadro's number:

    .. math::

        a(Langmuir) = n_m A_N \sigma

    *Limitations*

    The Langmuir method for determining surface area assumes that only one single
    layer is adsorbed on the surface of the material. As most adsorption processes
    (except chemisorption) don't follow this behaviour, it is important to regard
    the Langmuir surface area as an estimate.
