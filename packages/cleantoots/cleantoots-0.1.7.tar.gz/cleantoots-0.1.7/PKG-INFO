# Cleantoots
The idea of cleantoots is highly inspired by [magnusnissel/cleantweets](https://github.com/magnusnissel/cleantweets).

## Initial config

Only once

```bash
python -m pip install cleantoots
cleantoots setup-config  # See the following section for config options
cleantoots login
```

## Config options

```ini
# Any key in this section will serve as a default for other sections
[DEFAULT]

# Toots that have at least this number of boosts won't be deleted.
boost_limit = 5

# Toots that have at least this number of favorites won't be deleted.
favorite_limit = 5

# Toots that are more recent than this number of days won't be deleted.
days_count = 30

# The timezone to use for dates comparisons.
timezone = Europe/Paris

# Each section represents an account.
[Fosstodon]
# Your Mastodon server URL.
api_base_url = https://fosstodon.org

# These files are used to store app information obtained when running `login`.
# The files must be different between accounts. Two different files are required per account.
app_secret_file = fosstodon_app.secret
user_secret_file = fosstodon_user.secret

# IDs of toots you want to protect (never delete).
# You can find the toot ID in the URL when viewing a toot.
protected_toots = 103362008817616000
    103361883565013391
    103363106195441418

# Another account
[Mastodon.social]
api_base_url = https://mastodon.social
app_secret_file = mastodonsocial_app.secret
user_secret_file = mastodonsocial_user.secret

# Overriding some defaults
boost_limit = 10
favorite_limit = 30
days_count = 7
```

## Run

See `cleantoots config` for the current config.
