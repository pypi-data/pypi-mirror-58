Description: # django_nplusone
        Discover possible N+1 queries in Django ORM at runtime
        
        The objective of this library is to help you discover any N+1s in your code at development time. Enable logging of warnings by
        following instructions shown in Usage section. Run your Django app as usual and you will see warning logs of any possible N+1s if found.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Install the package from PyPI using `pip` as following
        
        ```
        pip install django_nplusone
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Once package is installed, you can register the package in your `settings.py` as:
        
        ```
        import nplusone
        
        if DEBUG:
            nplusone.show_nplusones()
        
        ```
        
        This should start logging possible N+1s warnings using your logger configuration. The library uses standard python `logging` module and uses logger by the name of `nplusone`.
        
        ## Test
        
        You can test the N+1 warning logging by putting some code as shown below somewhere in your application code that you know will get executed. Say you have a model `User` with a foreign key field `org` to `Organization` model.
        
        ```
        user = User.objects.all()[0]
        print(user.org)
        ```
