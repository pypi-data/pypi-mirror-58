# Hemlock

Hemlock provides tools and models for creating and deploying surveys. It aspires to be the most powerful and flexible method of survey creation.

## Documentation

You can find the latest documentation at [dsbowen.github.io/hemlock](dsbowen.github.io/hemlock).

## License

Hemlock was created first and foremost as a free, open-source tool for academic and non-profit research. I aim to obtain a license permitting unlimited free use for legitimate academic and non-profit research by February 2020.

Until I obtain this license, I require that all Hemlock users obtain written permission from its copyright holder, Dillon Bowen. Any use without written permission from the copyright holder is strictly prohibited.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my academic advisors Joseph Simmons, Philip Tetlock, and Barbara Mellers, for supporting me throughout this project.

I would also like to thank Sarah Yang Fenton Reed, an extraordinary coder, for her invaluable technical advice.
