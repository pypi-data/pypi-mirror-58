# wikiget

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/clpo13/wikiget.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/clpo13/wikiget)
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/wikiget.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/wikiget)

Something like wget for downloading a file from MediaWiki sites (like Wikipedia
or Wikimedia Commons) using only the file name or the URL of its description
page.

Requires Python 2.7 or 3.5+. Install with `pip install --user wikiget` or, if you're using
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), `brew tap clpo13/wikiget && brew install wikiget`.

## Usage

`wikiget [-h] [-V] [-q | -v] [-f] [-a] [--site SITE] [-o OUTPUT] FILE`

If `FILE` is in the form `File:Example.jpg` or `Example.jpg`, it will be fetched
from the default site, which is "commons.wikimedia.org". If it's the fully-qualified
URL of a file description page, like `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Example.jpg`,
the file is fetched from the specified site, in this case "en.wikipedia.org".
Full URLs may contain characters your shell interprets differently, so you can
either escape those characters with a backslash `\` or surround the entire URL
with single `'` or double `"` quotes.

The site can also be specified with the `--site` flag, though this will not have
any effect if the full URL is given.

More detailed information, such as the site used and full URL of the file, can be
displayed with `-v` or `--verbose`. Use `-vv` to display even more detail. `-q` can
be used to silence warnings.

By default, the program won't overwrite existing files with the same name as the
target, but this can be forced with `-f` or `--force`. Additionally, the file can
be downloaded to a different name with `-o`.

Files can be batch downloaded with the `-a` or `--batch` flag. In this mode, `FILE`
will be treated as an input file containing multiple files to download, one filename
or URL per line. If an error is encountered, execution stops immediately and the
offending filename is printed.

### Examples

```bash
wikiget File:Example.jpg
wikiget --site en.wikipedia.org File:Example.jpg
wikiget https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Example.jpg -o test.jpg
```

## Future plans

- batch download by (Commons) category or user uploads
- download from any MediaWiki-powered site, not just Wikimedia projects
- maybe: download Wikipedia articles, in plain text, wikitext, or other formats

## Contributing

It's recommended that you use a
[virtual environment manager](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)
like venv or [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)) to
install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/clpo13/wikiget.git  # if you plan on submitting pull requests, fork the repo instead
cd wikiget

# Python 2 or 3
pip install --user virtualenv
virtualenv venv

# Python 3
python3 -m venv venv
```

To activate the virtual environment, use one of the following commands:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux and macOS; activate.csh and activate.fish are also available
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows (Command Prompt or PowerShell)
```

Then run `pip install -e .` to invoke an
["editable" install](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#editable-installs),
meaning any changes made to the source will be reflected immediately in the
executable script. Unit tests can be run with `python setup.py test`.
