# PyLMeasure: A Python Wrapper for LMeasure.

[PyLMeasure](https://pypi.org/project/pylmeasure/) is a Python wrapper library for the [command-line interface](http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/help/cmdLineUsageDoc.html) of the neuronal morphology analysis tool [L-Measure](http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/help/index.htm).

# Installation

To install the library, simply type in `pip install pylmeasure` in your terminal.

The above command includes the necessary binaries -- no need to download L-Measure separatelly or install Java.

# Usage

The basic usage is:

```
from pylmeasure import *

# Specify the L-Measure to compute, full list: http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/help/index.htm
LMOutput = getOneMeasure('Surface', 'path/to/cell.swc')

print("Surface area:",  LMOutput["TotalSum"])
```

For more examples, see [this Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/JustasB/pylmeasure/blob/master/PyLMeasure%20Usage.ipynb).

# Issues
If you encounter an issue, first make sure it's not due to L-Measure itself -- this library simply wraps the L-Measure executables. If it is, please contact the [L-Measure team](http://cng.gmu.edu:8080/Lm/). If the issue is with this library, please create an [issue on Github](https://github.com/JustasB/pylmeasure/issues).

# Contributing

To contribute, please [open an issue](https://github.com/JustasB/pylmeasure/issues) first and discuss your plan for contributing. Then fork this repository and commit [a pull-request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) with your changes.
