Giddy is an open-source python library for the analysis of dynamics of
longitudinal spatial data. Originating from the spatial dynamics module
in [PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library)](http://pysal.org/), it is under active development
for the inclusion of newly proposed analytics that consider the
role of space in the evolution of distributions over time.

*Below are six choropleth maps of US state per-capita incomes from 1929 to 2004 at a fifteen-year interval.*

Documentation
-------------

Online documentation is available [here](https://giddy.readthedocs.io).


Features
--------
- Directional LISA, inference and visualization as rose diagram

[![rose_conditional](figs/rose_conditional.png)](notebooks/directional.ipynb)

*Above shows the rose diagram (directional LISAs) for US states incomes across 1969-2009 conditional on relative incomes in 1969.*

- Spatially explicit Markov methods:
    - Spatial Markov and inference
    - LISA Markov and inference
- Spatial decomposition of exchange mobility measure (rank methods):
    - Global indicator of mobility association (GIMA) and inference
    - Inter- and intra-regional decomposition of mobility association and inference
    - Local indicator of mobility association (LIMA)
        - Neighbor set LIMA and inference
        - Neighborhood set LIMA and inference
