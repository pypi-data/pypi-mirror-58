"""
This game engine is designed to let you create your own game engine.

Simply create a class derived from GameEngine and set property defaults
in the constructor. It is recommended that you also implement the
methods: `setup_input_mappings`.

Use the GameplayUtilities helper class to initialise your game engine
by calling `create_game_engine` supplied by your game engine class.

Any object in the world, including abstract manager classes, should
inherit from from `Actor`. Actors must be spawned by the world's
`spawn_actor` method and destroyed by the world's `destroy_actor'
method.

Actors receive vital gameplay methods including `begin_play`, `tick`
and `begin_destroy`. This helps tracking the lifetime of the actor,
though keep in mind memory management is performed by Python's GC.
It is highly recommended to use the `weakref` module to store actor
references to ensure that actors can be destroyed safely.
