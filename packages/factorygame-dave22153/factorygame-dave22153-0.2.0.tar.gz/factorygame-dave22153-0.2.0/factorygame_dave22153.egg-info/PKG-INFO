        Python game engine to have a 2d movable "graph".
        
        ## Overview
        
        ### Design
        
        Factorygame is a game engine meant for simple, minimalist games. It supports
        a large array of graphical features such as shapes, colors and lines. The
        framework is developed with the idea to enable rapid game development and
        prototyping, with a robust and extendable toolset.
        
        ### Flexibility
        
        The use of the Python scripting language throughout makes this engine highly
        flexible. It has an open source policy to support understanding and extending
        any part of the engine with ease. By letting users choose their workflow, it
        empowers them to use their existing techniques to speed up build times.
        
        ### Development Operations
        
        This game engine can cater to many experience levels. Python is already
        vastly popular and the number of users is growing. Nothing in the framework
        is preventing users from building a game as it's designed to be a streamlined
        hassle-free time. Previous users of Godot's scripting language will feel at
        home.
        
        ## Installation
        
        Just download it and start working straight away. It is recommended to have
        some Python knowledge, although this is optional. First take a look at the
        included samples by executing `run_test.py`. This will showcase all the current
        included features.
        
        ## Usage
        
        You are free to use this engine as you wish. We would love to know if you have
        made a game with it.
