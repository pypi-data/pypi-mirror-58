Description: # Clitt
        
        Ever wanted to tweet straight from your terminal? Wait, is it just me?
        
        ## How to install it?
        
        I'm still working on deploying Clitt in a more friendly way but for now you can clone this repository, install all the dependencies (personally i recommend you use [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to handle this) and start using it.
        
        ## How to use it?
        
        Clitt is meant to be simple (or at least as simple as a command line client for Twitter can be), so you just need to execute the main script, `__init__.py`, choose an action and pass the required parameters to perform the action. 
        
        Running `__init__.py` for the first time will open a new tab on your browser with an authorization consent from Twitter, hit the authorize button, copy the code that will pop-up and paste it into the terminal. After the first time, your authorization token will be saved on your computer (and only there) for further uses.
