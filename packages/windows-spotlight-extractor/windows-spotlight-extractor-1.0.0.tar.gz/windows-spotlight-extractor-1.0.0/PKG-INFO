Description: # Windows 10 Spotlight Extractor
        
        This application will scrape the windows spotlight assets folder for wallpapers.
        The folder is located at
        ```
        %LOCALAPPDATA%/Packages/Microsoft.Windows.ContentDeliveryManager_cw5n1h2txyewy/LocalState/Assets
        ```
        
        Once found the wallpapers will be copied into the Spotlight images directory. By default this is:
        ```
        %USERPROFILE%/OneDrive/Pictures/Spotlight
        ```
        
        The application will filter only for images larger than 1920 x 1080
        
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Set the script to run on a schedule or just call using the CLI command ```spotlight```
        You should see an output similar to the following
        ```
        [2019-12-26 19:37:40,819] [root] [root] - Copying Windows Spotlight Images Into C:\Users\jonat\OneDrive\Pictures\Spotlight
        [2019-12-26 19:37:40,844] [root] [root] - Successfully Copied 3 files
        ```
        
        Modify the Settings in ```C:\Users\jonat\AppData\Local\w10-spotlight-extractor\settings.ini```
        
        I recommend adding the following to the settings to silence the output under the LOGGING section
        CORRECT THE USERNAME FIRST!
        ```
        file = C:\Users\jonat\AppData\Local\w10-spotlight-extractor\app.log
        ```
        
        
        ### Installing
        I Highly recommend using PIPX to install the spotlight extractor to ensure you do not run into issues with other environments and CLI apps installed using PIP   
        https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-stand-alone-command-line-tools/
        
        Install the spotlight extractor with pip into a Python3 Environment.
        ```
        pip3 install windows-spotlight-extractor
        ```
