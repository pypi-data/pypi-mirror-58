        #            - About to separate out and return non-strings, and so translations need to happen before that.
        #            - If we waited until after string -> type conversion, we run the risk of
        #              unhashable types, like dates, being tested for translation. Consider
        #              a time when the user wants to make epoch start (1970-01-01) translate to None.

        #       - Manipulations later in the processing may translate the string into something that should have been translated.
        #
