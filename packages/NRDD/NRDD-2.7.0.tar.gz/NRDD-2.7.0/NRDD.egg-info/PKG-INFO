Description: The NRDD_constraints tool provides simple interpolating functions 
                                  written in python that return the most constraining limit on the 
                                  dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section for a list of non-relativistic 
                                  effective operators that corresponds to the diagonal terms listed in Table 2 
                                  of arXiv: 1810.00607 with the exception of those proportional to a meson pole. 
                                  The package contains four files: The code, NRDD_constraints.py;
                                  A simple driver, NRDD_constraints-example.py; Two data files, NRDD_data1.npy, 
                                  NRDD_data2.npy
