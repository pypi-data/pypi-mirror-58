===========================
Tutorial 1 - Your first app
===========================

We're ready to create our first application.

Install the BeeWare tools
=========================

First, we need to install the beeware tools and libraries. BeeWare provides a
convenient shortcut for doing this: a ``beeware`` meta-package on PyPI that
includes all the pieces you'll need to run this tutorial. Make sure you're in
the ``beeware-tutorial`` you created in :doc:`Tutorial 0 <tutorial-0>`, with
the ``beeware-venv`` virtual environment activated, and run:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ pip install --pre beeware

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ pip install --pre beeware

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv)C:\...>pip install --pre beeware


ℹ️ : ``--pre`` is a flag to tell ``pip`` to install pre-release or development versions. This ensures you are installing the most recent development version of Beeware. 

One of the BeeWare tools is **Briefcase**. Briefcase can be used to package
your application for distribution to end users - but it can also be used to
bootstrap a new project.

Bootstrap a new project
=======================

Let's start our first BeeWare project!  Using the Briefcase ``new`` command,
we're going to create an application called **Hello World**. Run the following
from your command prompt:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase new

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase new

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase new

Briefcase will ask us for some details of our new application. For the
purposes of this tutorial, use the following:

* **Formal Name** - Accept the default value: ``Hello World``.

* **App Name** - Accept the default value: ``helloworld``.

* **Bundle** - If you own your own domain, enter that domain in reversed order.
  (For example, if you own the domain "cupcakes.com", enter ``com.cupcakes``
  as the bundle). If you don't own your own domain, accept the default bundle
  (``com.example``).

* **Project Name** - Accept the default value: ``Hello World``.

* **Description** - Accept the default value (or, if you want to be really
  creative, come up with your own description!)

* **Author** - Enter your own name here.

* **Author's email** - Enter your own email address. This will be used in the
  configuration file, in help text, and anywhere that an email is required
  when submitting the app to an app store.

* **URL** - The URL of the landing page for your application. Again, if you own
  your own domain, enter a URL at that domain (including the ``https://``).
  Otherwise, just accept the default URL (``https://example.com/helloworld``).
  This URL doesn't need to actually exist (for now); it will only be used if
  you publish your application to an app store.

* **License** - Accept the default license (BSD). This won't affect
  anything about the operation of the tutorial, though - so if you have
  particularly strong feelings about license choice, feel free to choose
  another license.

* **GUI framework** - Accept the default option, Toga (BeeWare's own GUI
  toolkit).

Briefcase will then generate a project skeleton for you to use. If you've
followed this tutorial so far, and accepted the defaults as described, your
file system should look something like::

    beeware-tutorial/
        beeware-venv/
            ...
        helloworld/
            LICENSE
            README.rst
            pyproject.toml
            src/
                helloworld/
                    resources/
                        helloworld.icns
                        helloworld.ico
                        helloworld.png
                    __init__.py
                    __main__.py
                    app.py

This skeleton is actually a fully functioning application without adding
anything else. The ``src`` folder contains all the code for the application,
and the ``pyproject.toml`` file describes how to package the application for
distribution. If you open ``pyproject.toml`` in an editor, you'll see the
configuration details you just provided to Briefcase.

Now that we have a stub application, we can use Briefcase to run the
application.

Run the app in developer mode
=============================

Move into the ``helloworld`` project directory and tell briefcase to start
the project in Developer (or ``dev``) mode:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ cd helloworld
      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase dev

      [hello-world] Installing dependencies...
      ...
      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. code-block:: bash

      (beeware-venv) $ cd helloworld
      (beeware-venv) $ briefcase dev

      [hello-world] Installing dependencies...
      ...
      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. code-block:: doscon

      (beeware-venv) C:\...>cd helloworld
      (beeware-venv) C:\...>briefcase dev

      [hello-world] Installing dependencies...
      ...
      [helloworld] Starting in dev mode...

This should open a GUI window:

.. tabs::

  .. group-tab:: macOS

    .. image:: images/macOS/tutorial-1.png
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 1 window, on macOS

  .. group-tab:: Linux

    .. image:: images/linux/tutorial-1.png
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 1 window, on Linux

  .. group-tab:: Windows

    .. image:: images/windows/tutorial-1.png
       :alt: Hello World Tutorial 1 window, on Windows

Press the close button (or select Quit from the application's menu), and you're
done! Congratulations - you've just written a standalone, native application
in Python!

Next steps
==========

We now have a working application, running in developer mode. Now we can add
some logic of our own to make our application do something a little more
interesting. In :doc:`Tutorial 2 <tutorial-2>`, we'll put a more useful user
interface onto our application.
