**Write Python. Run Anywhere.**

BeeWare is a suite of tools and libraries, each of which works together to help
you write cross platform native GUI Python applications. It includes:

* `Toga <toga.readthedocs.org>`__, a cross platform widget toolkit;
* `Briefcase <briefcase.readthedocs.org>`__, a tool for packaging Python
  projects as distributables artefacts that can be shipped to end users;
* `Rubicon ObjC <rubicon-objc.readthedocs.org>`__, a library for working with
  Objective C libraries on iOS and macOS from within Python code;
* `Rubicon Java <rubicon-java.readthedocs.org>`__, a library for working with
  Java libraries from within Python code;
* Pre-complied builds of Python that can be used on platforms where official
  Python installers aren't available.

You can use each of the tools in isolation, or you can use all of them as a
suite.

The full BeeWare suite also includes `software development tools
<https://beeware.org/project/projects/tools/>`__ and `applications
<https://beeware.org/project/projects/applications/>`__ that have been written
using BeeWare's own libraries.

The BeeWare suite is available on macOS, Windows, Linux (using GTK); on mobile
platforms such as Android and iOS; and for the Web. Support for other platforms
(such as set top boxes and watches) is on our long term roadmap.

.. admonition:: Platform support

    The BeeWare suite is a work in progress. Some tools and libraries are more
    mature than others, and some platforms have better support than others. In
    particular, our support for Android is known to have significant problems,
    and Web support should be considered experimental only.
