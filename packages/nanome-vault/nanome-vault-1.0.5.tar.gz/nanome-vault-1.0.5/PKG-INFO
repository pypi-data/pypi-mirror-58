Description: # Nanome - Vault
        
        ### A Nanome plugin that creates a web interface to upload files and make them available in Nanome
        
        Nanome Vault will start a web server. Other people can upload molecules or other files to it, and they will appear in Nanome. This works for both Nanome & Nanome Curie (Quest edition).
        
        Nanome Vault currently supports:
        
        - Molecules: .pdb, .cif, .sdf
        - Presentations: .pptx, .ppt, .odp
        - Documents: .pdf
        - Images: .png .jpg
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```sh
        $ pip install nanome-vault
        ```
        
        In order to load non-molecular files with Nanome Vault, the following applications/packages should be installed on the computer running the plugin:
        
        - ImageMagick
        - LibreOffice
        - Ghostscript
        
        For Windows especially, make sure that these applications are in the PATH environment variable (the folder containing simpress.exe should be in PATH for LibreOffice)
        
        On Ubuntu, a security policy might prevent ImageMagick from converting PDF to images.
        It can be removed by running:
        
        ```sh
        $ sudo mv /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xmlout
        ```
        
        See this answer on AskUbuntu for more information: https://askubuntu.com/a/1081907
        
        ### Usage
        
        To start the plugin:
        
        ```sh
        $ nanome-vault -a <plugin_server_address>
        ```
        
        On Linux, you might have to start using `sudo nanome-vault` to listen on port 80.
        
        #### Optional arguments:
        
        - `-w port`
        
          The port to use for the Web UI. Example: `-w 8080`
        
        - `-k days`
        
          Automatically delete files that haven't been accessed in a given number of days. Example: to delete untouched files after 2 weeks: `-k 14`
        
        - `-u url`
        
          The url to display in the plugin for accessing the Web UI. Example: `-u vault.example.com`
        
        In Nanome:
        
        - Activate Plugin
        - Click Run
        - Open your web browser, go to "127.0.0.1" (or your computer's IP address from another computer), and add supported files. Your files will appear in Nanome.
