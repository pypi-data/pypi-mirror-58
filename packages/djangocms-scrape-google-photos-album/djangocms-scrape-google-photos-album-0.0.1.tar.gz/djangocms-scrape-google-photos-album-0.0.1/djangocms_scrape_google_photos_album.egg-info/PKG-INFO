        **WARNING: This is implementation is likely to break due to the nature of scraping. The regex will
        need to be updated whenever google changes the structure of that page.**

        Note: Results are cached for **30 minutes**. If this doesn't serve your needs,
        [make an issue](https://github.com/k-funk/djangocms-scrape-google-photos-album/issues/new).
        
        #### `settings.py`:
        ```
        INSTALLED_APPS = (
            ...
            'djangocms_scrape_google_photos_album',
            ....
        )
        ```
        
        [Override the template](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/overriding-templates/)
        included, as it's likely to not be the html that you want. Below is an example of how you could use
        it with [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) and
        [featherlight.js](https://noelboss.github.io/featherlight/).
        
        #### `/my_project/templates/djangocms_scrape_google_photos_album/album.html`
        ```
        {% if photo_urls %}
          <div class="container-fluid">
            <div class="row" data-featherlight-gallery data-featherlight-filter="a" data-featherlight-type="image">
              {% for photo_url in photo_urls %}
                <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-4 col-md-3">
                  <a href="{{ photo_url }}=w1200-h1200">
                    <img src="{{ photo_url }}=w300-h300-c" class="img-responsive" />
                  </a>
                </div>
              {% endfor %}
            </div>
          </div>
        {% endif %}
        ```
