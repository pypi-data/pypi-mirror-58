Description: # TigerGraph Driver
        Python wrapper for querying TigerGraph
        
        ## Usage
        First, add TigerGraphDriver.py into your project's directory.
        ### Initialization
        There are a few parameters in order to instantiate a connection to your TigerGraph instance.  These include:
        * URL of the server (defaults to http://localhost)
        * Name of the Graph (defaults to MyGraph)
        * Username and Password (both default to tigergraph)
        * The API call port (default 9000)
        * The port for Interpreted Queries (default 14240)
        * The API Token (Can be obtained with the getToken() method)
        
        To instantiate the connection, simply use:
        ```py
        graph = tg.TigerGraphConnection(ipAddress="https://YOUR_URL_HERE", apiToken="YOUR_TOKEN_HERE")
        ```
        
        ### Other Methods
        #### runInstalledQuery(queryName, params)
        Assumes there is a query installed on the server, takes its name as an argument as a string, and the needed parameters as a dictionary. Returns JSON.
        
        #### getEndpoints()
        Returns the JSON of all possible endpoints on the server
        
        #### getToken(secret, lifetime)
        Returns a API token given a secret key and lifetime of the token, which are both strings.
        
        ## TODO:
        #### runInterpretedQuery(query) 
        Currently does not work, due to what appears to be an internal server issue.
