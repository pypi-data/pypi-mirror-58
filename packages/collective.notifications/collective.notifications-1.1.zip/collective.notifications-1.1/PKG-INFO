Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The package allows you to notify users of actions or action requests for
        site content and actions.
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Download the package from GitHub and extract into your src directory.
        Add 'collective.notifications' to your eggs and zcml slugs in buildout.
        Include the location (src/collective.notifications) in development slugs too.
        Run buildout
        
        In Site Setup -> Add-ons, activate Notifications.
        Once it is installed you will see "Notifications" under Add-on Configuration.
        This is where you can see and manage site notifications. There is also a
        link here to a form that allows admins to send notifications.
        
        
        Sending Notifications
        =====================
        
        To send notifications from code, use NotificationRequestedEvent. Send the
        event notification from the place in your code where it is required, using
        code similar to this:
        
        ::
        
            from zope.event import notify
            from collective.notification.interfaces import NotificationRequestedEvent
            notify(NotificationRequestedEvent(context,
                                              note,
                                              recipients,
                                              user=user_id,
                                              url=action_url,
                                              external='email',
                                              email_body=email_body,
                                              email_subject=email_subject,
                                              email_content_type=content_type,
                                              first_read=False))
        
        The `context` is the affected object. `note` is a plain text string with the
        description of the action that is being notified or needs to be performed;
        `recipients` is a list of user ids of all the users that will be notified,
        it allows the use of group ids with the prefix "group", so for example
        ['group:Reviewers', 'group:Staff', 'jsmith', 'jdoe'] would send the
        notification to all users of the groups reviewers and staff, as well as to
        individual users jsmith and jdoe. The special group "Members" will notify
        all portal users.
        
        The last seven parameters are optional: `user` can be the userid of the user
        associated with the notification. This is just in case we need a different
        user than the currently logged in user, which is the default. `url` will be
        used as a site action if provided, otherwise the context url will be used.
        `external` refers to external notification services (see below). Currently,
        the only service included is 'email'. The parameter can be a list, in which
        case the notification is sent using all the listed services. Default is None,
        so no external notifications will be sent if this parameter is omitted.
        Finally, `first_read`, if True, marks the notification as read for all
        recipients after one user reads it. This can be used to send a notification
        to a group where multiple users can take action, but can safely ignore the
        notification once someone reads it. Default is False. `email_body` is text for
        the body of the email sent by the 'email' external service. `note` will be used
        if `email_body` is not set. `email_body` should be either html or plain text.
        `email_content_type` should be 'text/html' if `email_body` is html.
        `email_subject` text for the subject of the email sent by the 'email' external
        service.
        
        
        External Notification Services
        ==============================
        
        Collective.notifications allowseasy integration with external notification
        services. Use the IExternalNotificationService interface for this. If a
        class implements this interface and it has a `send` method, it can be used
        as a service and included in the `external` parameter when sending a
        notification.
        
        Example:
        
        ::
        
            from zope.interface import implements
            from collective.notification.interfaces import IExternalNotificationService
        
            class TwitterNotifier(object):
                implements(IExternalNotificationService)
        
                def send(self, notification):
                    # send the tweet
                    ...
        
        This requires configuring the service as un utility in configure.zcml:
        
        ::
        
            <utility
              provides="collective.notifications.interfaces.IExternalNotificationService"
              factory=".external.TwitterNotifier"
              name="twitter"
            />
        
        
        Async and Celery
        ================
        
        Notifications attempts to use plone.app.async to perform the notifications,
        but if that fails it will finish the task directly.
        The advantage of this is to allow an individual 'worker' client
        to run Async and handle all of these request.
        If there is a lot of activity it will not get backed up.
        Async queues the job up and handles it as it can
        while the users request finishes and moves on
        avoiding sacrifices in performance.
        Refer to the collective.async pypi page
        for instructions on setting it up if you use it.
        Async is NOT required for Notifications to work,
        however it is advised, especially for high traffic sites.
        
        
        Note
        ====
        
        For inserting the number of pending notifications, the "toolbar.pt" template
        from plone.app.layout was overridden using z3c.jbot. Keep this in mind if
        your project has its own modifications for this template.
