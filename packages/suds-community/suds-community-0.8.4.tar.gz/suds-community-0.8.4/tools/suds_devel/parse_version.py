"""
Utility for converting version strings into a directly comparable tuple.

Shamelessly stolen from setuptools 3.7 (development version) where this code is
located in its pkg_resources.py module. The code has not been modified in any
way, including comments and coding style, so that it would be as easy as
possible to upgrade it to a newer version if that becomes needed.

Having this functionality in our project allows our tool scripts to run even
without locally installed setuptools installed, e.g. the script for setting up
the base development environments.

import re

component_re = re.compile(r'(\d+ | [a-z]+ | \.| -)', re.VERBOSE)
replace = {'pre':'c', 'preview':'c','-':'final-','rc':'c','dev':'@'}.get

def _parse_version_parts(s):
    for part in component_re.split(s):
        part = replace(part, part)
        if not part or part=='.':
            continue
        if part[:1] in '0123456789':
            # pad for numeric comparison
            yield part.zfill(8)
        else:
            yield '*'+part

    # ensure that alpha/beta/candidate are before final
    yield '*final'

def parse_version(s):
    """Convert a version string to a chronologically-sortable key

    This is a rough cross between distutils' StrictVersion and LooseVersion;
    if you give it versions that would work with StrictVersion, then it behaves
    the same; otherwise it acts like a slightly-smarter LooseVersion. It is
    *possible* to create pathological version coding schemes that will fool
    this parser, but they should be very rare in practice.

    The returned value will be a tuple of strings.  Numeric portions of the
    version are padded to 8 digits so they will compare numerically, but
    without relying on how numbers compare relative to strings.  Dots are
    dropped, but dashes are retained.  Trailing zeros between alpha segments
    or dashes are suppressed, so that e.g. "2.4.0" is considered the same as
    "2.4". Alphanumeric parts are lower-cased.

    The algorithm assumes that strings like "-" and any alpha string that
    alphabetically follows "final"  represents a "patch level".  So, "2.4-1"
    is assumed to be a branch or patch of "2.4", and therefore "2.4.1" is
    considered newer than "2.4-1", which in turn is newer than "2.4".

    Strings like "a", "b", "c", "alpha", "beta", "candidate" and so on (that
    come before "final" alphabetically) are assumed to be pre-release versions,
    so that the version "2.4" is considered newer than "2.4a1".

    Finally, to handle miscellaneous cases, the strings "pre", "preview", and
    "rc" are treated as if they were "c", i.e. as though they were release
    candidates, and therefore are not as new as a version string that does not
    contain them, and "dev" is replaced with an '@' so that it sorts lower than
    than any other pre-release tag.

    for part in _parse_version_parts(s.lower()):
        if part.startswith('*'):
