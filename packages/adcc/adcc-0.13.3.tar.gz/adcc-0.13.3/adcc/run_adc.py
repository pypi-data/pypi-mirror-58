    """Run an ADC calculation.

    Main entry point to run an ADC calculation. The reference to build the ADC
    calculation upon is supplied using the `data_or_matrix` argument.
    `adcc` is pretty flexible here. Possible options include:

        a. Hartree-Fock data from a host program, e.g. a molsturm SCF
           state, a pyscf SCF object or any class implementing the
           :py:class:`adcc.HartreeFockProvider` interface. From this data all
           objects mentioned in (b) to (d) will be implicitly created and will
           become available in the returned state.
        b. A :py:class:`adcc.ReferenceState` object
        c. A :py:class:`adcc.LazyMp` object
        d. A :py:class:`adcc.AdcMatrix` object

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_or_matrix
        Data containing the SCF reference
    n_states : int, optional
    kind : str, optional
    n_singlets : int, optional
    n_triplets : int, optional
    n_spin_flip : int, optional
        Specify the number and kind of states to be computed. Possible values
        for kind are "singlet", "triplet", "spin_flip" and "any", which is
        the default. For unrestricted references clamping spin-pure
        singlets/triplets is currently not possible and kind has to remain as
        "any". For restricted references `kind="singlets"` or `kind="triplets"`
        may be employed to enforce a particular excited states manifold.
        Specifying `n_singlets` is equivalent to setting `kind="singlet"` and
        `n_states=5`. Similarly for `n_triplets` and `n_spin_flip`.
        `n_spin_flip` is only valid for unrestricted references.

    conv_tol : float, optional
        Convergence tolerance to employ in the iterative solver for obtaining
        the ADC vectors (default: `1e-6` or SCF tolerance / 100,
        whatever is larger)

    solver_method : str, optional
        The eigensolver algorithm to use.

    n_guesses : int, optional
        Total number of guesses to compute. By default only guesses derived from
        the singles block of the ADC matrix are employed. See
        `n_guesses_doubles` for alternatives. If no number is given here
        `n_guesses = min(4, 2 * number of excited states to compute)`
        or a smaller number if the number of excitation is estimated to be less
        than the outcome of above formula.

    n_guesses_doubles : int, optional
        Number of guesses to derive from the doubles block. By default none
        unless n_guesses as explicitly given or automatically determined is
        larger than the number of singles guesses, which can be possibly found.

    guesses : list, optional
        Provide the guess vectors to be employed for the ADC run. Takes
        preference over `n_guesses` and `n_guesses_doubles`, such that these
        parameters are ignored.

    output : stream, optional
        Python stream to which output will be written. If `None` all output
        is disabled.

    core_orbitals : int or list or tuple, optional
        The orbitals to be put into the core-occupied space. For ways to
        define the core orbitals see the description in
        :py:class:`adcc.ReferenceState`.
        Required if core-valence separation is applied and the input data is
        given as data from the host program (i.e. option (a) discussed above)

    frozen_core : int or list or tuple, optional
        The orbitals to select as frozen core orbitals (i.e. inactive occupied
        orbitals for both the MP and ADC methods performed). For ways to define
        these see the description in :py:class:`adcc.ReferenceState`.

    frozen_virtual : int or list or tuple, optional
        The orbitals to select as frozen virtual orbitals (i.e. inactive
        virtuals for both the MP and ADC methods performed). For ways to define
        these see the description in :py:class:`adcc.ReferenceState`.

    Other parameters
    ----------------
    max_subspace : int, optional
        Maximal subspace size
    max_iter : int, optional
        Maximal number of iterations

    Returns
    -------
    ExcitedStates
        An :class:`adcc.ExcitedStates` object containing the
        :class:`adcc.AdcMatrix`, the :class:`adcc.LazyMp` ground state and the
        :class:`adcc.ReferenceState` as well as computed eigenpairs.

    Examples
    --------

    Run an ADC(2) calculation on top of a `pyscf` RHF reference of
    hydrogen flouride.

    >>> from pyscf import gto, scf
    ... mol = gto.mole.M(atom="H 0 0 0; F 0 0 1.1", basis="sto-3g")
    ... mf = scf.RHF(mol)
    ... mf.conv_tol_grad = 1e-8
    ... mf.kernel()
    ...
    ... state = adcc.run_adc(mf, method="adc2", n_singlets=3)

    The same thing can also be achieved using the `adcc.adcN` family of
    short-hands (see e.g. :py:func:`adcc.adc2`, :py:func:`adcc.cvs_adc2x`):

    >>> state = adcc.adc2(mf, n_singlets=3)

    Run a CVS-ADC(3) calculation of O2 with one core-occupied orbital

    >>> from pyscf import gto, scf
    ... mol = gto.mole.M(atom="O 0 0 0; O 0 0 1.2", basis="sto-3g")
    ... mf = scf.RHF(mol)
    ... mf.conv_tol_grad = 1e-8
    ... mf.kernel()
    ...
    ... state = adcc.cvs_adc3(mf, core_orbitals=1, n_singlets=3)
