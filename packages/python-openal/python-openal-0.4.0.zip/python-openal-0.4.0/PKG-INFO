Description: About PyAL
        ==========
        PyAL is a wrapper around the OpenAL library and as such similar to the
        discontinued PyOpenAL project. In contrast to PyOpenAL, it has no
        licensing restrictions, nor does it rely on C code, but uses ctypes
        instead.
        
        Installation
        ============
        For right now, you can only install from the source tree.
        * git clone https://github.com/NicklasMCHD/PyAL.git
        * cd PyAl
        * python setup.py install
        
        Documentation
        =============
        If you just started with OpenAL and PyAL, it is strongly recommended
        that you read through the *advanced sound support* section of the documentation
        to understand, how OpenAL works in general. In any case, you can find the
        documentation at *doc/html* or online at http://pythonhosted.org/PyAL (for the
        current stable release) or at http://pyal.readthedocs.org (for the current
        development release).

        restrictions. Please see *doc/copying.rst* for further details, if you need it.
