        ## Installation
        
        Install the latest development version:
        
        ```sh
        pip install git+https://github.com/ynop/pyphony.git
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        * [A supported version of Python 3](https://docs.python.org/devguide/index.html#status-of-python-branches)
        
        It's recommended to use a virtual environment when developing pyphony.
        To create one, execute the following command in the project's root directory:
        
        ```
        python -m venv .
        ```
        
        To install pyphony and all it's dependencies, execute:
        
        ```
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ### Running the test suite
        
        ```
        pip install -e .[dev]
        python setup.py test
        ```
        
        With PyCharm you might have to change the default test runner. Otherwise, it might only suggest to use nose. To do so,
        go to File > Settings > Tools > Python Integrated Tools (on the Mac it's PyCharm > Preferences > Settings > Tools >
        Python Integrated Tools) and change the test runner to py.test.
        
        
        ### Versions
        
        Versions is handled using [bump2version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version). To bump the version:
        
        ```
        bump2version [major,minor,patch,release,num]
        ```
        
        In order to directly go to a final relase version (skip .dev/.rc/...):
        
        ```
        bump2version [major,minor,patch] --new-version x.x.x
        ```
        
        ### Release
        
        Commands to create a new release on pypi.
        
        ```
        rm -rf build
        rm -rf dist
        
        python setup.py sdist
        python setup.py bdist_wheel
        twine upload dist/*
        ```
