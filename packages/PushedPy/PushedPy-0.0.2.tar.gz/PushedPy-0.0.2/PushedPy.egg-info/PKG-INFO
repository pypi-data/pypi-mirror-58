Description: # PushedPy
        PushedPy is a simple Python wrapper for the Pushed.co API, that allows you to send push notifications, in real-time, to iOS and Android devicesÂ + Chrome, Firefox and Safari browsers.
        
        To send push notifications through Pushed.co, you need two things:
        * Create an account onÂ https://pushed.co/
        * If you want to send push notifications to a mobile device, you need to download the Pushed.co app to the device.
        
        Pushed.co is a paid service, but they offer a sandbox plan that gives you the ability to send up to 1.000 messages pr. month, for free.
        
        ## Basic usage
        To send a push notification in it's simplest form, simply do:
        
        ```
        import Pushed
        
        pushed_obj = Pushed("MyAppKey", "MyAppSecret")
        r = pushed_obj.Notification("My message to send as a push notification")
        print(r)
        ```
        
        To send a push notification including an attached URL, add the URL when calling
        the Notification function:
        
        ```
        r = pushed_obj.Notification("My push message", "http://mysite.com")
        ```
