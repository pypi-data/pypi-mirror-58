Description: ***********
        simplestyle
        ***********
        
        This package was originally part of a Python tool to extract text data
        from PDFs into TEI XML. Some of the style information that was extracted
        from the PDF had to be recorded in the resulting TEI file. Among these
        were fontname, fontsize, italics, boldface, superscript, subscript.
        These were included as simple CSS statements into the ``tagsDecl`` of
        the TEI document.
        
        Later it seemed approporiate to remove this very simple style library
        from the PDF extraction package and offer it as a little standalone
        package, which can be useful in different contexts.
        
        NB: This package might be useful for some people, hence it is published
        as an open source package, but it is still very much tailored to some
        very special needs for text processing. It is not very likely that this
        package will be developed into a general CSS library. If you need this,
        you will find plenty of helpful libraries on PyPI.

        Simplified CSS
        ==============
        
        The simplified CSS grammar understood by this package is as follows::
        
            css := declaration (";" declaration)* ';'?
            declaration := property ":" expr
            property := [a-zA-Z-]+
            expr := (string | [^;"']+)
            string := string1 | string2
            string1 := "'" [^'\n\r\f] "'"
            string2 := '"' [^"\n\r\f] '"'
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        .. code:: pycon
        
            >>> from simplestyle import Style
            >>> css = "font-size: 10pt"
            >>> style = Style()
            >>> style.from_css(css)
            >>> style.size
            10.0
            >>> style.get_css()
            'font-size: 10.0pt'
            >>> style.italics
            False
            >>> style.from_css("font-style:italic", merge=True)
            >>> style.italics
            True
            >>> style.size
            10.0
            >>> style.get_css()
            'font-size: 10.0pt; font-style: italic'
            >>> style.reset()
            >>> style.get_css()
            ''
