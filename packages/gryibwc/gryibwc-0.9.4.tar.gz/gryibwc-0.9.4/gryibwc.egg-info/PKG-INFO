        Get a word count for all books read in a year. :book:
        
        Word count might be more accurate than pages, 
        since the page count depends on formatting and whatnot.
        However, the word counts are estimated based on the length 
        of the audio book version, which is still comparable across books.
        In any case, it makes for an interesting comparison of years.
        
        ## Installation
        `pip install gryibwc`
        
        ## Usage
        ```
        $ gryibwc -h
        usage: gryibwc [-h] [--version] [--fast] userid year
        
        positional arguments:
          userid      goodreads user id
          year        desired year
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          --version   show program's version number and exit
          --fast      skip wait time - risk getting banned
        ```
        Output e.g.:
        ```
        Overall word count for year 2019: 4731925
        ```
