    "# Cachew: quick NamedTuple/dataclass cache\n",
    "TLDR: cachew can persistently cache any sequence (an [Iterator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Iterator)) over [NamedTuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.NamedTuple) or [dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html) into an sqlite database on your disk.\n",
    "Database schema is automatically inferred from type annotations ([PEP 526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526)).\n",
    "\n",
    "It works in a similar manner to [functools.lru_cache](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache): caching your data is just a matter of decorating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference from `functools.lru_cache` is that data is preserved between program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "I often find myself processing big chunks of data, computing some aggregates on it or extracting only bits I'm interested at. While I'm trying to utilize REPL as much as I can, some things are still fragile and often you just have to rerun the whole thing in the process of development. This can be frustrating if data parsing and processing takes seconds, let alone minutes in some cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "Conventional way of dealing with it is serializing results along with some sort of hash (e.g. md5) of input files,\n",
    "comparing on the next run and returning cached data if nothing changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple as it sounds, it is pretty tedious to do every time you need to memorize some data, contaminates your code with routine and distracts you from your main task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example\n",
    "Imagine you're working on a data analysis pipeline for some huge dataset, say, extracting urls and their titles from Wikipedia archive.\n",
    "Parsing it (`extract_links` function) takes hours, however, the archive is presumably updated not very frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With this library your can achieve it through single `@cachew` decorator."
