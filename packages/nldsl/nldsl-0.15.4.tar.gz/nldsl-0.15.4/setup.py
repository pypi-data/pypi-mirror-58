LONG_DESC = "NLDSL is a tool to create domain specific languages (DSLs) for data science, \
which can be translated into executable code. A new DSL is created by deriving from \
the CodeGenerator class and rules are added to it via simple python functions. \
Besides providing code generation NLDSL allows the user to define DSL-level function, \
which are then treated as first-class rules. \
Currently we provide extensions for Pandas and PySpark."
